00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.375
Do you know Ammit?

2
00:00:09.458 --> 00:00:13.625
Egyptian deity, right?
World's first bogeyman.

3
00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:17.416
ARTHUR: The justice of A mm it surveys
the whole of our lives.

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.875
That's why we have to resurrect her.

5
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.625
And she'll light the path
to heal the world.

6
00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:25.333
You brought this upon yourself, Khonshu.

7
00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:29.708
(GODS CHANTING IN COPTIC)

8
00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:33.083
Now, he's tethered to this place.

9
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.833
It's gotta be one of the big'uns.

10
00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:38.250
We won.

11
00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:42.625
Steven.

12
00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.625
- You know Steven?
- Of course I know Steven.

13
00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.375
- If we can't calmly...
- (SCREAMS)

14
00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.250
- STEVEN: Marc? Marc!
- Steven!

15
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.458
We gotta get out of here.

16
00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:03.208

BOY: Help!

19
00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:57.041
This is all your fault!

20
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.875
(BOTH SCREAMING)

21
00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.833
DR. HARROW: Calm down. Marc? Marc.

22
00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:04.166
I didn't shoot you.

23
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.291
Your mind is violently vacillating between

24
00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.458
sense and nonsense.

25
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:12.583
Picture this, all right?
Your brain is a pendulum,

26
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:16.541
swinging between a very difficult reality,

27
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.000
that you are my patient
here at Putnam Medical Facility

28
00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:21.791
in Chicago, Illinois,

29
00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:27.166
and a reassuring fantasy
that you've created on your own.

30
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.791
That you're some kind of,
I don't know, superhero. All right?

31
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:35.000
You are doing everything and
everything possible not to look within.

32
00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:36.833
You're not really a doctor.

33
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.083
DR. HARROW: Is that why you keep starting
imaginary fights in our hospital?

34
00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:42.416
No, you're not a doctor.

35
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.000
Look. I feel real.
I feel like a real doctor.

36
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.166
You're not a doctor.

37
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:49.625
Well, all right.

38
00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:50.750
(CHUCKLES)

39
00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:54.041
I'm not a real doctor.
Okay, well, all right, all right.

40
00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.208
It's not about me, okay?

41
00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:00.250
Let's start with you.
Let's try it your way. Retrace your steps.

42
00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:03.916
Tell me. Tell me.
How did you come to be here today?

43
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.583
How did you get here?

44
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:08.208
I took the bus,

45
00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:10.250
like I always do.

46
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.916
You wanna know what you told me,
how you got here?

47
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.458
You told me that you were in a place
that was oddly reminiscent of this office,

48
00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:23.000
except that it was in Egypt, right?
And that you were with a rhinoceros

49
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.000
- and...
- Hippopotamus.

50
00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:28.083
You're right, I'm...
You're right, it was a hippopotamus,

51
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.625
but it talked.

52
00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:36.625
Now, what do you think?
Do you think that is sense

53
00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:38.625
or nonsense?

54
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:43.541
Nonsense?

55
00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.291
I find this really encouraging.

56
00:03:46.916 --> 00:03:49.166
Honestly, I do.

57
00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:53.750
The struggling mind
will often build places

58
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.375
to seek shelter
for different aspects of the self

59
00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:59.291
from our most traumatic memories.

60
00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.375
It's called just
an organizing principle, okay?

61
00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:05.333
Some people, they see a castle, right?

62
00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:08.833
Somebody else will see a maze,
or a library.

63
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.958
Or a... psych ward?

64
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:19.166
Yeah. Or it could be.
Could be a psych ward. Yeah.

65
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.833
What I find extremely interesting
is this new... The new animal character.

66
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.208
Um...

67
00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:30.791
- Hippopotamus?
- I find that really interesting.

68
00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:35.041
This hippo could break down the walls
between you and Steven,

69
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.083
and we might finally understand.

70
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:40.708
Understand what?

71
00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:45.916
Well, before you got upset,
you were talking to me about a boy.

72
00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:48.958
- Do you remember that boy?
- Mmm-hmm.

73
00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:51.583
You think you could tell me
about that little boy?

74
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:59.416
Hey, thank you. I feel really great.

75
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.541
Yeah.

76
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:04.083
I mean, they must pay you
a lot of money in this place.

77
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.708
- You know what?
- You're really good.

78
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.583
I tell you what, I feel like
a million dollars, never felt so good.

79
00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:11.500
I'm gonna see myself out. Thank you.
Doctor! No, you're not...

80
00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:14.541
You're gonna release that monster...
He's gonna destroy everything!

81
00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.125
- He's gonna destroy everything!
- Be gentle with him!

82
00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:19.041
Listen, I am not your enemy!

83
00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:21.375
No! No!

84
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.833
(BOTH SCREAMING)

85
00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:25.000
Hippo! Hippo!

86
00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:26.458
Oh, man!

87
00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:28.666
Wow, these meds are really amazing.

88
00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:31.750
Is he always so intense?

89
00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:33.791
Who, him? Yeah, pretty much.

90
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.416
HIPPO: So, are you two, like, twins?

91
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.125
- No.
- Well, yes, sort of.

92
00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:39.833
HIPPO: Okay, great.

93
00:05:39.916 --> 00:05:42.166
That's really cleared this
whole situation up for me.

94
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.250
That makes two of us.

95
00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.791
Just a second ago,
I thought I'd been shot to death.

96
00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:48.666
Oh, gosh!
This will really bake your noodle,

97
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.958
but I think you were just taking
a little time-out.

98
00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:53.666
I'm afraid you're actually quite dead.

99
00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:55.250
I'm sorry, what?

100
00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:57.541
But...

101
00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.166
I'm dead? We're dead?

102
00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:01.416
Yes.

103
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.333
Yes, Marc. I think she's right.

104
00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:06.916
I think we died.

105
00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:10.875
HIPPO: I actually... I have...
Hold on a sec.

106
00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:13.625
It's been a minute
since we've had a soul pass through here.

107
00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:17.500
Bit distracted... Excuse me.

108
00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:21.958
A-ha! Okay, here we go.

109
00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.000
Welcome, gentle traveler... Travelers,

110
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:34.458
to the realm of the Duat.

111
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:36.875
Duat? The Egyptian underworld.

112
00:06:37.416 --> 00:06:38.666
This is Taweret,

113
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.208
- goddess of women and children...
- MARC: Uh-huh.

114
00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:44.833
...and she's guiding us through
our journey to the afterlife.

115
00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:47.125
- Wow.
- MARC: Okay.

116
00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:53.125
Right. So, this is the afterlife?

117
00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:57.791
- The afterlife?
- An afterlife. Not the afterlife.

118
00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:00.500
You'd be surprised how many
intersectional planes

119
00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:02.875
- of untethered consciousness exist.
- Yeah.

120
00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:07.666
(GASPS) Like the Ancestral Plane.
Oh! Just gorgeous. Anyway.

121
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.291
I do actually have cards for all this

122
00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:13.541
if you just wait, and... I'm sorry.

123
00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:15.208
Wait... Bye.

124
00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:16.875
(GASPS SOFTLY) Okay, so...

125
00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.666
Because the Duat's true nature
is impossible for the human mind

126
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.833
- to comprehend...
- Right.

127
00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:26.708
...you may perceive this realm
as something

128
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:28.625
more easily recognizable to you.

129
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:32.041
- Uh-huh.
- A psych ward's a first for me,

130
00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:35.166
but, hey, we can roll with it, right?

131
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:39.416
Why would we imagine this realm
to be a psychiatric hospital?

132
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.208
Because we're insane.

133
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.333
(MARC EXHALES)

134
00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.375
We're insane.

135
00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:50.458
This talking hippo,

136
00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:54.833
talking dead bird,
you're outside of my body now.

137
00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:57.000
And now the afterlife, right?

138
00:07:57.083 --> 00:08:00.083
- That's the reality and this...
- STEVEN: But Marc, Marc.

139
00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:04.083
The hospital. That's the imagination.

140
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:08.583
- Sorry, he's...
- Oh, man. Dr. Harrow's right.

141
00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:10.166
Dr. Harrow?

142
00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.833
This is an organizing principle.

143
00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:15.125
- Is he a doctor now?
- MARC: I'll prove it you.

144
00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:18.125
So, like, right through these doors,
for example,

145
00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.333
we go through here,
there's gonna be patients,

146
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:23.750
and there's Crawley
probably about to yell bingo!

147
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.333
Oh, my God!

148
00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.000
Oh, my God!

149
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:35.666
What is this?

150
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.000
This is the underworld.

151
00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:38.958
I'm not crazy.

152
00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:40.583
I'm dead.

153
00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:43.500
- Where did you say we're going?
- We're sailing to A'aru.

154
00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:46.416
To the Field of Reeds, right, Taweret?

155
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.458
Ah, so he's the smart one, hey?

156
00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:53.416
Well, if your heart's balanced in life,
then you will spend eternity in paradise.

157
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.375
The Field of Reeds.

158
00:08:55.791 --> 00:09:00.583
But before we get there,
I've just got to do a quick little...

159
00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:06.750
- Whoa! Easy! Easy, easy, easy there!
- (TAWERET GASPS)

160
00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:10.666
Oh, goody! It worked! Look at that!

161
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.666
Here was little old me worrying I'd blow
your chests wide open.

162
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.041
STEVEN: Sorry, what?

163
00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:17.833
MARC: Wait, what's she doing?

164
00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:21.208
STEVEN: She's weighing our hearts
on the Scales of Justice

165
00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:22.583
and the Feather of Truth.

166
00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:25.375
You see, the ancient Egyptians believed
that the heart

167
00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:28.125
was the sign of
who you really were in life.

168
00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:31.500
If the Scales balance
by the time you end the journey,

169
00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:34.458
then a soul is permitted to pass
into the Field of Reeds.

170
00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:38.250
- MARC: What if they don't balance?
- You get thrown overboard. Whoo!

171
00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:40.958
The dead will drag you down into the Duat,

172
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:44.166
where you will remain forever,
frozen in sand.

173
00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.416
No unbalanced souls on my boat.

There's no way we're ending up down there.

the Field of Reeds, either.

- If it comes to it,

178

we arrive at the Field of Reeds,

- So how are we supposed to do this?

Not sure. You think Layla's all right?

197
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:05.416
Yeah, for now.

198
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:09.458
And knowing her, she'll go on
a suicide mission to stop Harrow herself.

199
00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:12.041
That means we better hurry, doesn't it?

200

202

one hippo and two of us,

203
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.458

that hard to steer. So...

- Have to what? Kill the Goddess Taweret?

No, just, you know, find me a rope and...

206
00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:27.833
Yeah. Or we can do what she says,

207
00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:31.291
and help each other uncover whatever it is
that we're hiding, apparently.

231
00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:27.375
You killed all of them?

232
00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:32.041
They were criminals. Murderers. Predators.
The worst of the worst.

233
00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:33.500
Khonshu wanted them punished.

It's what he meant by
protecting the travelers of the night.

00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:42.375
a happy, simple, normal life.
You understand?

523
00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:44.166
But it was all a lie, wasn't it?

524
00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:45.416
So what?

525
00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:47.291
What does it matter?

526
00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:49.208
What? You wanna remember the truth?

527
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:52.916
That you had a mother that beats you?
That hated you?

528
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
That made your life a living hell?

529
00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:57.125
You're lying.
You're just trying to upset me.

530
00:31:57.208 --> 00:31:59.875
But you've gotten to live
thinking that she loved you.

531
00:32:00.208 --> 00:32:03.250
That she was kind. That she's still alive!

532
00:32:06.541 --> 00:32:07.625
What?

533
00:32:08.166 --> 00:32:09.333
What are you talking about?

534
00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:12.458
She's alive. I speak to her every day.
What are you talking about?

535
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.916
Dad called me after all these years,

536
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.541
about her Shiva, and I couldn't do it.

537
00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:22.708
No, this is all wrong.
This is... No, this is all wrong.

538
00:32:22.791 --> 00:32:24.666
- Steven, I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

539
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.166
No, no, no. No, thank you.

540
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.333
- No. Let me out, let me out!
- Calm down. It's all right. It's okay.

541
00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:32.375
Let me out, let me out! (GRUNTS)

542
00:32:34.208 --> 00:32:36.958
God. I'm so sorry. Sorry...

543
00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:39.000
God. I'm so sorry. Sorry...

544
00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:42.500
You gave me a real start there.
Gave you a bit of a wash, didn't I?

545
00:32:42.958 --> 00:32:44.000
Steven?

546
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.625
Hold on a minute. What's this...

547
00:32:48.541 --> 00:32:49.875
It's good to see you again.

548
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:51.750
What is this? Is this some kind of test?

549
00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:54.666
I recognize this place.

550
00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:55.916
What's this?

551
00:32:56.583 --> 00:32:59.666
- Steven, I'm your doctor. Remember?
- (SCOFFS) You're my doctor?

552
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.625
- I'm here to help you.
- Dr. Harrow, yeah, is it?

553
00:33:02.708 --> 00:33:04.708
- That's right.
- Oh, yeah, look at that.

554
00:33:05.041 --> 00:33:06.291
Well...

555
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.750
You've really gone up in the world,
haven't you?

556
00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:11.541
I was beginning to worry we might
never speak again.

557
00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:18.250
It's so strange. The little haircut.
Little silly 'tache there.

558
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.500
It's very Ned Flanders.

559
00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:24.791
- Steven.
- What's Taweret up to now?

560
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.375
It's my fault. I asked Marc
to open up to you.

561
00:33:28.458 --> 00:33:30.458
Did he get a chance to speak with you?

562
00:33:31.916 --> 00:33:33.333
Yeah, well, he...

563
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.166
He lied to me. That's what he did.

564
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.375
Mmm-hmm. And what do you feel
that he lied to you about?

565
00:33:40.208 --> 00:33:41.750
Oh. Nosy.

566
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:45.875
No, it's just...
Steven, when you first came in here,

567
00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:48.875
I was worried you were never
gonna be able to acknowledge Marc.

568
00:33:48.958 --> 00:33:50.291
What do you mean we're not...

569
00:33:51.416 --> 00:33:52.625
I brought us here?

570
00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:55.958
After your mother passed.

571
00:33:56.458 --> 00:33:58.458
Oi. Don't say that.

572
00:33:59.041 --> 00:34:00.416
That's not true.

573
00:34:00.833 --> 00:34:01.833
That's not true.

574
00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:03.041
Oh, I'm so... I must...

575
00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:05.375
You having a laugh as well?
I don't wanna hear it.

576
00:34:05.458 --> 00:34:07.583
- Steven, I must be mistaken.
- My mother is alive.

577
00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:10.083
You say that again,
I will freak out! I promise.

578
00:34:10.166 --> 00:34:11.500
I must be mistaken. Okay?

579
00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:15.041
Would you like to speak with her?
Why don't we call her?

580
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.750
You don't have her number.

581
00:34:16.833 --> 00:34:18.416
Yeah, we have it on file.

582
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.000
- Hold on, let me just get Dylan.
- No, don't do that.

583
00:34:21.083 --> 00:34:22.166
It'll take two seconds.

584
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:23.541
Don't bother her.

585
00:34:23.625 --> 00:34:26.708
Hey, Dylan. Yeah.
Could you call Mrs. Grant, please?

586
00:34:26.791 --> 00:34:28.541
She screens her calls. She won't answer.

587
00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:31.333
- She's afraid of tele salespeople.
- She'll wanna talk to you.

588
00:34:31.416 --> 00:34:33.750
I'm sure of it. She's getting the number.

589
00:34:33.833 --> 00:34:34.875
Don't do that.

590
00:34:34.958 --> 00:34:36.833
Okay, okay. Thank you.

591
00:34:36.916 --> 00:34:38.583
- Please don't do that.
- It's ringing.

592
00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:40.083
Don't bother her, please.

593
00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:44.000
Uh, hello, Mrs. Grant.
Yes, this is Dr. Harrow.

594
00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:45.250
Mmm-hmm.

595
00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:48.125
Steven's here.
He'd like to speak with you.

596
00:34:49.166 --> 00:34:52.375
Steven, would you like to speak
to your mum?

597
00:35:02.791 --> 00:35:04.000
My mum...

598
00:35:07.833 --> 00:35:08.916
(SOFTLY) My mum is dead.

599
00:35:17.833 --> 00:35:19.000
My mum is dead.

600
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:03.500
MARC: No, no. Not gonna do it.

601
00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:06.708
I'm not giving you that satisfaction.

602
00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:35.666
I'm so sorry.

603
00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:40.750

Oh, bollocks.

610
00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:19.375
Not again.

611
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.125
Heya, Mum. Hey, you all right?

612
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:23.291
Yeah, um...

I am totally lost again.

I don't know where I am.
What an absolute muppet!

615

No, I know I did it again,
but I don't know.

616
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.708
I'm looking down a street...

617
00:37:36.833 --> 00:37:39.291
Kinda looks a bit like Mayfair. I think...

on the wrong side. Sorry.

and Shiva two months ago.

started bleeding into each other.

I couldn't...

623
00:37:53.208 --> 00:37:55.583
I just couldn't...
I couldn't face that again.

624
00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.041
All the things I'd done...

625
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:00.291
Marc,

626
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.041
all those horrible things
that she said to you,

627
00:38:04.125 --> 00:38:06.208
she was wrong. It wasn't your fault.

628
00:38:08.458 --> 00:38:10.958
I shouldn't have brought him in the cave.

629
00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:12.125
Hey.

630
00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:16.416
Hey. You were just a child.

to the world above so close.

640

I'm so sorry. Your Scales never balanced.

I cannot stop the inevitable.
