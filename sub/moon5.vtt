00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:12.575
Do you know Ammit?

2
00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:16.825
Egyptian deity, right?
World's first bogeyman.

3
00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:20.616
ARTHUR: The justice of A mm it surveys
the whole of our lives.

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.075
That's why we have to resurrect her.

5
00:00:23.158 --> 00:00:25.825
And she'll light the path
to heal the world.

6
00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:28.533
You brought this upon yourself, Khonshu.

7
00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:32.908
(GODS CHANTING IN COPTIC)

8
00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.283
Now, he's tethered to this place.

9
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.033
It's gotta be one of the big'uns.

10
00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:41.450
We won.

11
00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:45.825
Steven.

12
00:00:46.158 --> 00:00:49.825
- You know Steven?
- Of course I know Steven.

13
00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:52.575
- If we can't calmly...
- (SCREAMS)

14
00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.450
- STEVEN: Marc? Marc!
- Steven!

15
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.658
We gotta get out of here.

16
00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.408

BOY: Help!

19
00:01:56.283 --> 00:02:00.241
This is all your fault!

20
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.075
(BOTH SCREAMING)

21
00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:06.033
DR. HARROW: Calm down. Marc? Marc.

22
00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:07.366
I didn't shoot you.

23
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.491
Your mind is violently vacillating between

24
00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:12.658
sense and nonsense.

25
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:15.783
Picture this, all right?
Your brain is a pendulum,

26
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:19.741
swinging between a very difficult reality,

27
00:02:19.825 --> 00:02:23.200
that you are my patient
here at Putnam Medical Facility

28
00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:24.991
in Chicago, Illinois,

29
00:02:25.116 --> 00:02:30.366
and a reassuring fantasy
that you've created on your own.

30
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.991
That you're some kind of,
I don't know, superhero. All right?

31
00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:38.200
You are doing everything and
everything possible not to look within.

32
00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.033
You're not really a doctor.

33
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.283
DR. HARROW: Is that why you keep starting
imaginary fights in our hospital?

34
00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:45.616
No, you're not a doctor.

35
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.200
Look. I feel real.
I feel like a real doctor.

36
00:02:50.283 --> 00:02:51.366
You're not a doctor.

37
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:52.825
Well, all right.

38
00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:53.950
(CHUCKLES)

39
00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:57.241
I'm not a real doctor.
Okay, well, all right, all right.

40
00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.408
It's not about me, okay?

41
00:03:00.783 --> 00:03:03.450
Let's start with you.
Let's try it your way. Retrace your steps.

42
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:07.116
Tell me. Tell me.
How did you come to be here today?

43
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.783
How did you get here?

44
00:03:10.408 --> 00:03:11.408
I took the bus,

45
00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:13.450
like I always do.

46
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.116
You wanna know what you told me,
how you got here?

47
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.658
You told me that you were in a place
that was oddly reminiscent of this office,

48
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:26.200
except that it was in Egypt, right?
And that you were with a rhinoceros

49
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:28.200
- and...
- Hippopotamus.

50
00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:31.283
You're right, I'm...
You're right, it was a hippopotamus,

51
00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:32.825
but it talked.

52
00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:39.825
Now, what do you think?
Do you think that is sense

53
00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:41.825
or nonsense?

54
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:46.741
Nonsense?

55
00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:49.491
I find this really encouraging.

56
00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:52.366
Honestly, I do.

57
00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:56.950
The struggling mind
will often build places

58
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.575
to seek shelter
for different aspects of the self

59
00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:02.491
from our most traumatic memories.

60
00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.575
It's called just
an organizing principle, okay?

61
00:04:05.658 --> 00:04:08.533
Some people, they see a castle, right?

62
00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:12.033
Somebody else will see a maze,
or a library.

63
00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:14.158
Or a... psych ward?

64
00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:22.366
Yeah. Or it could be.
Could be a psych ward. Yeah.

65
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.033
What I find extremely interesting
is this new... The new animal character.

66
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.408
Um...

67
00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:33.991
- Hippopotamus?
- I find that really interesting.

68
00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:38.241
This hippo could break down the walls
between you and Steven,

69
00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:40.283
and we might finally understand.

70
00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:43.908
Understand what?

71
00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:49.116
Well, before you got upset,
you were talking to me about a boy.

72
00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:52.158
- Do you remember that boy?
- Mmm-hmm.

73
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.783
You think you could tell me
about that little boy?

74
00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:02.616
Hey, thank you. I feel really great.

75
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.741
Yeah.

76
00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:07.283
I mean, they must pay you
a lot of money in this place.

77
00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:08.908
- You know what?
- You're really good.

78
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.783
I tell you what, I feel like
a million dollars, never felt so good.

79
00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:14.700
I'm gonna see myself out. Thank you.
Doctor! No, you're not...

80
00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:17.741
You're gonna release that monster...
He's gonna destroy everything!

81
00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:20.325
- He's gonna destroy everything!
- Be gentle with him!

82
00:05:20.408 --> 00:05:22.241
Listen, I am not your enemy!

83
00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:24.575
No! No!

84
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.033
(BOTH SCREAMING)

85
00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:28.200
Hippo! Hippo!

86
00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:29.658
Oh, man!

87
00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:31.866
Wow, these meds are really amazing.

88
00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:34.950
Is he always so intense?

89
00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:36.991
Who, him? Yeah, pretty much.

90
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.616
HIPPO: So, are you two, like, twins?

91
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.325
- No.
- Well, yes, sort of.

92
00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:43.033
HIPPO: Okay, great.

93
00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:45.366
That's really cleared this
whole situation up for me.

94
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.450
That makes two of us.

95
00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:48.991
Just a second ago,
I thought I'd been shot to death.

96
00:05:49.075 --> 00:05:51.866
Oh, gosh!
This will really bake your noodle,

97
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.158
but I think you were just taking
a little time-out.

98
00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:56.866
I'm afraid you're actually quite dead.

99
00:05:57.366 --> 00:05:58.450
I'm sorry, what?

100
00:05:59.741 --> 00:06:00.741
But...

101
00:06:01.825 --> 00:06:03.366
I'm dead? We're dead?

102
00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:04.616
Yes.

103
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.533
Yes, Marc. I think she's right.

104
00:06:07.616 --> 00:06:10.116
I think we died.

105
00:06:11.116 --> 00:06:14.075
HIPPO: I actually... I have...
Hold on a sec.

106
00:06:14.283 --> 00:06:16.825
It's been a minute
since we've had a soul pass through here.

107
00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:20.700
Bit distracted... Excuse me.

108
00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:25.158
A-ha! Okay, here we go.

109
00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:35.200
Welcome, gentle traveler... Travelers,

110
00:06:35.491 --> 00:06:37.658
to the realm of the Duat.

111
00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:40.075
Duat? The Egyptian underworld.

112
00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:41.866
This is Taweret,

113
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.408
- goddess of women and children...
- MARC: Uh-huh.

114
00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:48.033
...and she's guiding us through
our journey to the afterlife.

115
00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.325
- Wow.
- MARC: Okay.

116
00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:56.325
Right. So, this is the afterlife?

117
00:06:56.575 --> 00:07:00.991
- The afterlife?
- An afterlife. Not the afterlife.

118
00:07:01.325 --> 00:07:03.700
You'd be surprised how many
intersectional planes

119
00:07:03.783 --> 00:07:06.075
- of untethered consciousness exist.
- Yeah.

120
00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:10.866
(GASPS) Like the Ancestral Plane.
Oh! Just gorgeous. Anyway.

121
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.491
I do actually have cards for all this

122
00:07:13.575 --> 00:07:16.741
if you just wait, and... I'm sorry.

123
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.408
Wait... Bye.

124
00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:20.075
(GASPS SOFTLY) Okay, so...

125
00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:25.866
Because the Duat's true nature
is impossible for the human mind

126
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.033
- to comprehend...
- Right.

127
00:07:27.116 --> 00:07:29.908
...you may perceive this realm
as something

128
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.825
more easily recognizable to you.

129
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:35.241
- Uh-huh.
- A psych ward's a first for me,

130
00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:38.366
but, hey, we can roll with it, right?

131
00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:42.616
Why would we imagine this realm
to be a psychiatric hospital?

132
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.408
Because we're insane.

133
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.533
(MARC EXHALES)

134
00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:51.575
We're insane.

135
00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:53.658
This talking hippo,

136
00:07:54.366 --> 00:07:58.033
talking dead bird,
you're outside of my body now.

137
00:07:58.116 --> 00:08:00.200
And now the afterlife, right?

138
00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:03.283
- That's the reality and this...
- STEVEN: But Marc, Marc.

139
00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:07.283
The hospital. That's the imagination.

140
00:08:08.325 --> 00:08:11.783
- Sorry, he's...
- Oh, man. Dr. Harrow's right.

141
00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:13.366
Dr. Harrow?

142
00:08:14.408 --> 00:08:16.033
This is an organizing principle.

143
00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:18.325
- Is he a doctor now?
- MARC: I'll prove it you.

144
00:08:18.408 --> 00:08:21.325
So, like, right through these doors,
for example,

145
00:08:21.408 --> 00:08:23.533
we go through here,
there's gonna be patients,

146
00:08:23.616 --> 00:08:26.950
and there's Crawley
probably about to yell bingo!

147
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.533
Oh, my God!

148
00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:30.200
Oh, my God!

149
00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:38.866
What is this?

150
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.200
This is the underworld.

151
00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:42.158
I'm not crazy.

152
00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:43.783
I'm dead.

153
00:08:43.866 --> 00:08:46.700
- Where did you say we're going?
- We're sailing to A'aru.

154
00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:49.616
To the Field of Reeds, right, Taweret?

155
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.658
Ah, so he's the smart one, hey?

156
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:56.616
Well, if your heart's balanced in life,
then you will spend eternity in paradise.

157
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.575
The Field of Reeds.

158
00:08:58.991 --> 00:09:03.783
But before we get there,
I've just got to do a quick little...

159
00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:09.950
- Whoa! Easy! Easy, easy, easy there!
- (TAWERET GASPS)

160
00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:13.866
Oh, goody! It worked! Look at that!

161
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.866
Here was little old me worrying I'd blow
your chests wide open.

162
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.241
STEVEN: Sorry, what?

163
00:09:19.866 --> 00:09:21.033
MARC: Wait, what's she doing?

164
00:09:21.116 --> 00:09:24.408
STEVEN: She's weighing our hearts
on the Scales of Justice

165
00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:25.783
and the Feather of Truth.

166
00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:28.575
You see, the ancient Egyptians believed
that the heart

167
00:09:28.658 --> 00:09:31.325
was the sign of
who you really were in life.

168
00:09:31.783 --> 00:09:34.700
If the Scales balance
by the time you end the journey,

169
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.658
then a soul is permitted to pass
into the Field of Reeds.

170
00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:41.450
- MARC: What if they don't balance?
- You get thrown overboard. Whoo!

171
00:09:42.366 --> 00:09:44.158
The dead will drag you down into the Duat,

172
00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:47.366
where you will remain forever,
frozen in sand.

173
00:09:48.158 --> 00:09:51.616
No unbalanced souls on my boat.

There's no way we're ending up down there.

176

the Field of Reeds, either.

- If it comes to it,

178

186

we arrive at the Field of Reeds,

00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:00.033

- So how are we supposed to do this?

Not sure. You think Layla's all right?

197
00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:08.616
Yeah, for now.

198
00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:12.658
And knowing her, she'll go on
a suicide mission to stop Harrow herself.

199
00:11:13.408 --> 00:11:15.241
That means we better hurry, doesn't it?

200

202

one hippo and two of us,

203
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.658

that hard to steer. So...

- Have to what? Kill the Goddess Taweret?

No, just, you know, find me a rope and...

206
00:11:29.325 --> 00:11:31.033
Yeah. Or we can do what she says,

207
00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:34.491
and help each other uncover whatever it is
that we're hiding, apparently.

Surely not all of them?

231
00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:30.575
You killed all of them?

232
00:13:31.325 --> 00:13:35.241
They were criminals. Murderers. Predators.
The worst of the worst.

233
00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:36.700
Khonshu wanted them punished.

234

It's what he meant by
protecting the travelers of the night.

00:31:40.616 --> 00:31:45.575
a happy, simple, normal life.
You understand?

523
00:31:45.658 --> 00:31:47.366
But it was all a lie, wasn't it?

524
00:31:47.616 --> 00:31:48.616
So what?

525
00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:50.491
What does it matter?

526
00:31:50.783 --> 00:31:52.408
What? You wanna remember the truth?

527
00:31:52.866 --> 00:31:56.116
That you had a mother that beats you?
That hated you?

528
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.200
That made your life a living hell?

529
00:31:58.283 --> 00:32:00.325
You're lying.
You're just trying to upset me.

530
00:32:00.408 --> 00:32:03.075
But you've gotten to live
thinking that she loved you.

531
00:32:03.408 --> 00:32:06.450
That she was kind. That she's still alive!

532
00:32:09.741 --> 00:32:10.825
What?

533
00:32:11.366 --> 00:32:12.533
What are you talking about?

534
00:32:12.616 --> 00:32:15.658
She's alive. I speak to her every day.
What are you talking about?

535
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.116
Dad called me after all these years,

536
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.741
about her Shiva, and I couldn't do it.

537
00:32:21.825 --> 00:32:25.908
No, this is all wrong.
This is... No, this is all wrong.

538
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:27.866
- Steven, I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

539
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.366
No, no, no. No, thank you.

540
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.533
- No. Let me out, let me out!
- Calm down. It's all right. It's okay.

541
00:32:33.616 --> 00:32:35.575
Let me out, let me out! (GRUNTS)

542
00:32:37.408 --> 00:32:40.158
God. I'm so sorry. Sorry...

543
00:32:40.283 --> 00:32:42.200
God. I'm so sorry. Sorry...

544
00:32:42.575 --> 00:32:45.700
You gave me a real start there.
Gave you a bit of a wash, didn't I?

545
00:32:46.158 --> 00:32:47.200
Steven?

546
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.825
Hold on a minute. What's this...

547
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:53.075
It's good to see you again.

548
00:32:53.158 --> 00:32:54.950
What is this? Is this some kind of test?

549
00:32:56.366 --> 00:32:57.866
I recognize this place.

550
00:32:58.075 --> 00:32:59.116
What's this?

551
00:32:59.783 --> 00:33:02.866
- Steven, I'm your doctor. Remember?
- (SCOFFS) You're my doctor?

552
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.825
- I'm here to help you.
- Dr. Harrow, yeah, is it?

553
00:33:05.908 --> 00:33:07.908
- That's right.
- Oh, yeah, look at that.

554
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:09.491
Well...

555
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.950
You've really gone up in the world,
haven't you?

556
00:33:12.033 --> 00:33:14.741
I was beginning to worry we might
never speak again.

557
00:33:17.075 --> 00:33:21.450
It's so strange. The little haircut.
Little silly 'tache there.

558
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.700
It's very Ned Flanders.

559
00:33:25.283 --> 00:33:27.991
- Steven.
- What's Taweret up to now?

560
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.575
It's my fault. I asked Marc
to open up to you.

561
00:33:31.658 --> 00:33:33.658
Did he get a chance to speak with you?

562
00:33:35.116 --> 00:33:36.533
Yeah, well, he...

563
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.366
He lied to me. That's what he did.

564
00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.575
Mmm-hmm. And what do you feel
that he lied to you about?

565
00:33:43.408 --> 00:33:44.950
Oh. Nosy.

566
00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:49.075
No, it's just...
Steven, when you first came in here,

567
00:33:49.158 --> 00:33:52.075
I was worried you were never
gonna be able to acknowledge Marc.

568
00:33:52.158 --> 00:33:53.491
What do you mean we're not...

569
00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:55.825
I brought us here?

570
00:33:57.825 --> 00:33:59.158
After your mother passed.

571
00:33:59.658 --> 00:34:01.658
Oi. Don't say that.

572
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:03.616
That's not true.

573
00:34:04.033 --> 00:34:05.033
That's not true.

574
00:34:05.116 --> 00:34:06.241
Oh, I'm so... I must...

575
00:34:06.366 --> 00:34:08.575
You having a laugh as well?
I don't wanna hear it.

576
00:34:08.658 --> 00:34:10.783
- Steven, I must be mistaken.
- My mother is alive.

577
00:34:10.866 --> 00:34:13.283
You say that again,
I will freak out! I promise.

578
00:34:13.366 --> 00:34:14.700
I must be mistaken. Okay?

579
00:34:14.783 --> 00:34:18.241
Would you like to speak with her?
Why don't we call her?

580
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.950
You don't have her number.

581
00:34:20.033 --> 00:34:21.616
Yeah, we have it on file.

582
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.200
- Hold on, let me just get Dylan.
- No, don't do that.

583
00:34:24.283 --> 00:34:25.366
It'll take two seconds.

584
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:26.741
Don't bother her.

585
00:34:26.825 --> 00:34:29.908
Hey, Dylan. Yeah.
Could you call Mrs. Grant, please?

586
00:34:29.991 --> 00:34:31.741
She screens her calls. She won't answer.

587
00:34:31.825 --> 00:34:34.533
- She's afraid of tele salespeople.
- She'll wanna talk to you.

588
00:34:34.616 --> 00:34:36.950
I'm sure of it. She's getting the number.

589
00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:38.075
Don't do that.

590
00:34:38.158 --> 00:34:40.033
Okay, okay. Thank you.

591
00:34:40.116 --> 00:34:41.783
- Please don't do that.
- It's ringing.

592
00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:43.283
Don't bother her, please.

593
00:34:43.366 --> 00:34:47.200
Uh, hello, Mrs. Grant.
Yes, this is Dr. Harrow.

594
00:34:47.283 --> 00:34:48.450
Mmm-hmm.

595
00:34:49.241 --> 00:34:51.325
Steven's here.
He'd like to speak with you.

596
00:34:52.366 --> 00:34:55.575
Steven, would you like to speak
to your mum?

597
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:07.200
My mum...

598
00:35:11.033 --> 00:35:12.116
(SOFTLY) My mum is dead.

599
00:35:21.033 --> 00:35:22.200

MARC: No, no. Not gonna do it.

601
00:36:07.866 --> 00:36:09.908
I'm not giving you that satisfaction.

602
00:36:37.783 --> 00:36:38.866
I'm so sorry.

603
00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:43.950

Oh, bollocks.

610
00:37:21.283 --> 00:37:22.575
Not again.

611
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.325
Heya, Mum. Hey, you all right?

612
00:37:25.491 --> 00:37:26.491
Yeah, um...

I am totally lost again.

I don't know where I am.
What an absolute muppet!

615

No, I know I did it again,
but I don't know.

616
00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:38.908
I'm looking down a street...

617
00:37:40.033 --> 00:37:42.491
Kinda looks a bit like Mayfair. I think...

on the wrong side. Sorry.

and Shiva two months ago.

started bleeding into each other.

623
00:37:56.408 --> 00:37:58.783
I just couldn't...
I couldn't face that again.

624

All the things I'd done...

625
00:38:02.325 --> 00:38:03.491
Marc,

626
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.241
all those horrible things
that she said to you,

627
00:38:07.325 --> 00:38:09.408
she was wrong. It wasn't your fault.

628
00:38:11.658 --> 00:38:14.158
I shouldn't have brought him in the cave.

629
00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:15.325
Hey.

630
00:38:16.658 --> 00:38:19.616
Hey. You were just a child.

640
