1
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.700
Steven, what did you do?

2
00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:13.333
I don't know how to explain
what's been happening.

3
00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:16.416
- What are you?
- I serve Khonshu. I'm his Avatar.

4
00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:20.375
We protect the vulnerable
and deliver Khonshu's justice.

5
00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.541
Khonshu's retribution
comes too late.

6
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:28.041
A mm it will light the path to good
by eradicating the choice of evil.

7
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.166
We found A mm it.

8
00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:33.583
While the cruel masses
fill this world with sin,

9
00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.500
they deserve to face her judgment.

10
00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:38.059
The other gods? What about them?

11
00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:40.333
They're gonna stand by
let somebody release A mm it?

12
00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:43.958
To signal for an audience
with the gods is to risk their wrath.

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.041
A mm it was buried in secret.
The location hidden even from the gods.

14
00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:51.458
- But someone had to know something.
- One man. A medjay named Senfu.

15
00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:54.625
Find Senfu's sarcophagus
and you'll find your tomb.

16
00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.333
It's a map,
to something really, really big.

17
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.541
Unless we know exactly what
the sky looked like on that date,

18
00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:04.708
we're buggered.

19
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:09.125
When the gods imprison me,
tell Marc to free me.

20
00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:19.750
- Marc?
- I want you to remember one thing.

21
00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:23.458
Your torment forged me.
I owe my victory to you.

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

23
00:02:55.708 --> 00:03:00.250
Steven. Wake up. Come on.
Wake the hell up!

24
00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:19.208
What?

25
00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:40.958
We can't lose more time.
Harrow must be headed back to the tomb.

26
00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:45.375
Look, if he is,
we're gonna need Marc, yeah?

27
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.833
Exactly. See, she gets it.

28
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.375
- No.
- No?

29
00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:56.125
No. See, the thing is,
we made a deal, Marc and I,

30
00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.333
that when he was done with Khonshu,
he would disappear for good.

31
00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:03.791
But that deal didn't involve you getting
Layla and us killed, did it?

32
00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.291
- That's not gonna fly with me.
- You guys made a deal?

33
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.458
That he would just disappear from my life?

34
00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:15.000
And you didn't think that maybe
I should've been made aware of that?

35
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.083
Oh.

36
00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:23.750
Well, hadn't he disappeared
from your life already?

37
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.875
Yeah. I mean, whatever.
His suit was his best feature, wasn't it?

38
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:31.333
Didn't even have that anymore.

39
00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:35.375
Steven, give me the body right now.
This is a suicide mission.

40
00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.375
Plus, I know him.
He'd wanna lone wolf this whole thing.

41
00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.875
It's not happening.
We're not gonna do that.

42
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:45.833
We are not. It's just you and me,
and the open road.

43
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:50.166
- We're gonna go on foot from here.
- Yeah, all right.

44
00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:49.500
There they are. Let's keep moving.

45
00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.458
It looks like they're already inside.

46
00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:54.833
We'll need to find another way
to beat them to A mm it.

47
00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:11.916
Hello.

48
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:20.571
Let's check for supplies.

49
00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.875
- You look scared.
- I'm not.

50
00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:44.916
Well, you should be.

51
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.250
Without Khonshu, there's no more suit,
no more healing, no more power.

52
00:08:48.458 --> 00:08:51.833
Yeah, no more you, I thought.
It's what you said, isn't it?

53
00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.541
But believing anything that comes
out of your mouth

54
00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:56.083
just shows what a plonker I am.

55
00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:58.708
Look, I wish I could just disappear.
I really do.

56
00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:00.625
But unfortunately, I'm still here.

57
00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.333
If you're gonna go through with this,
you gotta be smart, for Layla's sake.

58
00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:06.708
I've been in situations like this before.

59
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.166
So have I. It's the same body, isn't it?

60
00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.416
It's in there somewhere.
Muscle memory and that.

61
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.083
I'm not sure it works that way. Just...

62
00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:17.208
- Whatever.
- I'm here.

63
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.625
- You're not alone.
- I know I'm not alone.

64
00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:22.208
I know I'm bloody not alone.
I've got Layla.

65
00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:25.333
- She's got my back.
- Are you in love?

66
00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:26.833
Are you in love with my wife?

67
00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:30.208
I appreciate your concern, mate.
I really do. But we've got it from here.

68
00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:32.125
I swear to you, Steven. I swear...

69
00:09:32.208 --> 00:09:35.208
If I need a recipe for a protein shake
or something, I'll call you.

70
00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:36.666
I'll throw us off a cliff!

71
00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:59.541
I have to say, I feel like I've been
waiting for this my whole life.

72
00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:01.500
The adventure, I mean.

73
00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:06.416
- I know. We want what we never had.
- Yeah.

74
00:10:11.708 --> 00:10:12.875
You smell like him.

75
00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:17.875
- I mean, why wouldn't you, right?
- Yeah.

76
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.250
Marc's trying to protect you from Khonshu.

77
00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:25.791
- What?
- That's why he's been pushing you away.

78
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:29.833
He thinks Khonshu wants you for
his Avatar, and he won't let that happen.

79
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.166
I'm sorry.
I just felt like you should know that.

80
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Sorry.

81
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.416
Why are you telling me this now?

82
00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:45.541
I don't know.
I just thought you deserved to know.

83
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.166
Well, it wasn't his call to make.

84
00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:55.041
I don't need protection.
What I need is honesty.

85
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.541
- Yeah. I get that.
- That's more of a "you" thing, isn't it?

86
00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:06.833
What? Being... Honesty?

87
00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:11.916
Yeah. Being honesty.

88
00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:30.916
Yeah.

89
00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:37.083
- I'm gonna go down first.
- Okay. Yeah. Great.

90
00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:40.833
- Before I belay.
- Thank you. What's "belay"?

91
00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:46.041
I still can't tell when
you're joking or not.

92
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:49.500
All right.

93
00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:58.333
Oh, shit.

94
00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958
- Are you okay?
- I'm aces. Yeah.

95
00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:26.416
Okay.

96
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.416
- Here you go.
- I wish you hadn't seen that.

97
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.708
Yeah. All the years...

98
00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.291
Oh, wow, look at you.

99
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.875
Yeah, there's... Gorgeous, aren't they?
They're just, like...

100
00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:44.958
- Been standing guard for centuries.
- Right? Look, I can't even...

101
00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:50.833
Like, if they just sprang
to life right now

102
00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.833
and asked me a riddle for passage,
I'd be thrilled.

103
00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:55.708
I'd shit myself but I'd be thrilled.

104
00:12:58.666 --> 00:12:59.791
What's this?

105
00:13:03.125 --> 00:13:04.500
- Did you do that?
- What?

106
00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:10.625
Oh. Yeah. It's for my father.
He would've loved to be here.

107
00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.250
Oh, yeah? Big history buff, is he?

108
00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:17.666
So much worse. Archaeologist on a mission.

109
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.041
Cool.

110
00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:28.125
And to him it was a dream
worth dying for. And he did.

111
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:34.375
Um...

112
00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:35.875
I'm so sorry.

113
00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.875
- Yeah. No, it's fine, really.
- Yeah.

114
00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:41.666
It's fine. Happens.

115
00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:47.125
I bet that he'd be positively
beaming right now,

116
00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:49.666
seeing you standing in the proof of it.

117
00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:53.708
Yeah. I think so.

118
00:13:56.833 --> 00:14:00.000
Well, it's not such a bad way
to go, is it?

119
00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:03.958
Let's find out?

120
00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:08.916
Yeah. Yeah, let's find out.

121
00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:11.625
It's a nice way to die.

122
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.750
Strange.

123
00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:27.916
- It's a maze.
- It's a-maze-ing.

124
00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:31.125
- No, like, there are six paths.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:36.958
- Right. Six points.
- What would they be shooting at?

126
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.000
This whole structure

127
00:14:54.708 --> 00:14:55.958
is a symbol.

128
00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:59.750
- That's the eye of Horus.
- Yeah.

129
00:15:01.541 --> 00:15:02.875
Look at that.

130
00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:04.750
- What?
- Right?

131
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.250
Look, the royal symbol,
protection in the afterlife.

132
00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:11.666
I mean, like, the resources
needed to build this thing.

133
00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:19.000
- Her final Avatar was a pharaoh.
- Whoa! A bloody pharaoh.

134
00:15:19.458 --> 00:15:22.458
- So what? You think it's a map?
- Yeah, well...

135
00:15:23.291 --> 00:15:28.041
Right. So, the eye of Horus
is also the eye of mind, yeah?

136
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:31.250
Representing the six senses, six points.

137
00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:33.666
So you got the eyebrow
that denotes thoughts.

138
00:15:34.083 --> 00:15:39.000
Pupil, sight, obviously.
This point here is, uh, hearing.

139
00:15:39.416 --> 00:15:45.083
This, smell. Touch.
And this long line ending in a spiral

140
00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:47.666
is the tongue.

141
00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:53.000
The Avatar would be A mm it's voice.

142
00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:56.958
That's right.

143
00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:23.416
Oh, wow.

144
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500
Oh. Heka priests.

145
00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:28.166
Judging by their masks
and ceremonial stance.

146
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.333
They would've been entombed
in here to protect the pharaoh.

147
00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:34.625
The heck's a Heka?

148
00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:38.083
Sorcerers of their time.
They've been down here for centuries.

149
00:16:38.291 --> 00:16:41.208
These must be some of
the unlucky souls who crossed their path.

150
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.208
Right. An impressive send-off.

151
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:50.416
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Is that fresh blood?

152
00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:53.625
Isn't that little chunks of meaty bits?

153
00:16:58.041 --> 00:16:59.041
Oh.

154
00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:07.458
- Let's keep moving.
- Yeah.

155
00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:08.958
Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:12.791
Um, just a minute. Just a minute.

157
00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:20.750
I'm just saying what I see, and I see lots
of bones and blood going that way.

158
00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:26.375
So I'm just thinking, like,
what if there's maybe another...

159
00:17:28.083 --> 00:17:29.583
There's, like, another...

160
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.666
There's an opening up there. You see that?

161
00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:34.250
Yeah.

162
00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:35.750
- Should we check it out?
- Yeah.

163
00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:37.375
- All right.
- All right. You go.

164
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.500
- Me?
- You.

165
00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:39.875
Yeah, all right. Yeah.

166
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.416
- I did it. I'm up.
- You good?

167
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.500
Yeah.

168
00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:58.833
So, according to the ancient texts,
A mm it should be bound to an ushabti,

169
00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:00.458
statue thingies.

170
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:05.875
- How's it looking?
- It's looking amazing.

171
00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:12.416
I mean, this... It looks like a freshly
filled canopic jar, and snake skins,

172
00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.708
- and self-regeneration...
- Steven?

173
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.083
- Steven?
- Yeah?

174
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:18.041
The exit.

175
00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:26.500
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we can go this way.

176
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.583
- Harrow.
- What are they shooting at?

177
00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:34.916
I don't know.

178
00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:38.833
Hide. Hide.

179
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:37.416
Run! I'll find you!

180
00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:45.041
I squished it. I squished it.

181
00:21:15.791 --> 00:21:16.791
Steven?

182
00:24:31.458 --> 00:24:32.916
Oh, my days.

183
00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:38.958
First one in. Tomb fit for a pharaoh.

184
00:24:40.916 --> 00:24:41.916
Thutmose II.

185
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.333
Nefertiti.
Oh, it's gotta be one of the big'uns.

186
00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:50.791
So, you kissed her.

187
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:56.791
What are you gonna do?
Try and drown us now?

188
00:24:57.083 --> 00:24:58.291
Yeah, I should.

189
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.500
But you also told her the truth
about why I've been pushing her away.

190
00:25:04.375 --> 00:25:05.875
And that was unexpected.

191
00:25:06.875 --> 00:25:07.875
Yeah.

192
00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:11.625
Wow. Look at that.
Look at all these relics.

193
00:25:13.625 --> 00:25:15.125
Macedonian? No. What?

194
00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:20.000
No way. That's not right.
That can't be right. That's Macedonian.

195
00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:22.500
But the only pharaoh...

196
00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:26.083
But, I mean, he insisted
on calling himself Egyptian.

197
00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:29.250
But...

198
00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:40.583
I think we're looking
at the long-lost tomb

199
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.333
of Alexander the Great.

200
00:25:56.458 --> 00:25:58.041
You handled that beautifully.

201
00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:01.791
Why do all men like you

202
00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:08.583
feel it necessary to be
just so condescending?

203
00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:18.666
My little scarab.

204
00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:22.166
Isn't that what your father
used to call you?

205
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.041
Abdullah El-Faouly.

206
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:31.333
One of Egypt's most unique archaeologists.

207
00:26:35.083 --> 00:26:37.333
He would be so proud of you

208
00:26:38.958 --> 00:26:41.791
if he knew that you were among the first

209
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:47.208
to confirm for the world
what he always believed.

210
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.250
Egyptian gods walk among us.

211
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.041
The scales

212
00:26:58.375 --> 00:27:04.208
achieve their judgment by revealing
to me moments of sin and pain.

213
00:27:05.708 --> 00:27:07.041
And your husband...

214
00:27:08.708 --> 00:27:11.000
He is in agony.

215
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:14.625
More pain than anyone could bear.

216
00:27:15.916 --> 00:27:17.708
But he still hasn't told you the truth.

217
00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:20.500
Well, you're obviously dying to.

218
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:27.291
So why don't you just go ahead?
The floor is yours.

219
00:27:30.625 --> 00:27:31.791
I read his scales.

220
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.958
The scales do not lie.

221
00:27:43.541 --> 00:27:46.291
Everything inside me is
screaming not to open this thing.

222
00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:49.458
You want Harrow
to get to A mm it first?

223
00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:51.000
All right, all right, all right.

224
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.041
Oh, man.

225
00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:16.458
- Where's the ushabti?
- Well...

226
00:28:16.791 --> 00:28:20.500
If you're gonna hide it for all eternity,
you'd probably put it in a place where

227
00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:22.541
the average looter wouldn't think to look.

228
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.125
So what do you think?

229
00:28:26.916 --> 00:28:27.916
Um...

230
00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:35.958
Alexander was the voice of A mm it.

231
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:44.583
All right. I'm gonna try something.
I'll do something here.

232
00:28:46.916 --> 00:28:51.083
Sorry. Oh, God. So sorry.
Sorry, Mr. Great.

233
00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:02.875
All right. Open up. Sorry, Mr. Great.

234
00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:05.791
Sorry. I couldn't be more sorry.

235
00:29:09.416 --> 00:29:10.416
Ugh! Ew!

236
00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:14.333
Yeah, that's it. Get in there.
Reach in there, buddy.

237
00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:15.583
Oh...

238
00:29:20.083 --> 00:29:22.916
Your father was murdered
by mercenaries.

239
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.375
And no one knows who they were, do they?

240
00:29:28.791 --> 00:29:32.416
You're saying that Marc was one of them?

241
00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:36.833
You said it. What do you think?

242
00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:45.583
Marc remembers everything
that happened that day.

243
00:29:46.416 --> 00:29:48.583
Everyone who died.

244
00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:52.416
But one man stands out.

245
00:29:54.041 --> 00:29:58.125
Man with a fuchsia scarf.

246
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:00.916
Scarab details.

247
00:30:02.375 --> 00:30:05.791
Handmade. Made by his daughter perhaps.

248
00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:16.041
Are you done?

249
00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:27.625
I do hope you find closure.

250
00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:34.500
Wake up!

251
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:42.666
Sir, we just found another way.

252
00:31:02.041 --> 00:31:04.291
Layla, look. We won.

253
00:31:07.416 --> 00:31:10.000
And the ushabti goes to us.

254
00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:15.375
I had to go digging down old Alexander
the Great's gullet, but I found it.

255
00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:20.333
You all right, love?

256
00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:23.166
Can he hear me?

257
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.625
Alexander? I don't think so.
God, I hope not.

258
00:31:27.375 --> 00:31:30.125
What happened to my father?

259
00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:34.250
- I'm talking to you.
- What?

260
00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:36.250
I'm talking to you, Marc!

261
00:31:42.875 --> 00:31:44.500
- Come on. Let's go, let's go.
- No.

262
00:31:44.666 --> 00:31:46.875
- We need to go right now.
- Marc, no. No.

263
00:31:47.041 --> 00:31:49.666
- What happened to my father?
- Listen to me.

264
00:31:50.083 --> 00:31:53.916
We need to leave right now. I will explain
everything, I swear. But we have to go.

265
00:31:54.083 --> 00:31:57.500
Did you kill Abdullah El-Faouly?

266
00:31:58.458 --> 00:32:01.958
Of course not. Of course I didn't.

267
00:32:09.125 --> 00:32:10.250
But you were there.

268
00:32:11.791 --> 00:32:13.375
- You were there.
- I...

269
00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:15.458
Yeah, you were there.

270
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:20.250
I was there. Yeah, I was there.

271
00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:26.291
Yeah. And how did he die?

272
00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:36.166
My partner got greedy

273
00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:40.291
and he executed everyone at the dig site.

274
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:47.125
I tried to save your father,
but I couldn't save him. And I...

275
00:32:49.458 --> 00:32:54.708
No. But you brought
a killer right to him. Right?

276
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

277
00:32:58.125 --> 00:33:00.166
He shot me too.
I was supposed to die that night.

278
00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:04.333
But I didn't die that night.
And I should have.

279
00:33:07.833 --> 00:33:09.833
I've tried to tell you
since the moment we met.

280
00:33:11.208 --> 00:33:14.333
- I just didn't know...
- Oh, my God.

281
00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:21.541
That's the reason that we met.

282
00:33:24.583 --> 00:33:26.583
You just had a guilty conscience.

283
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:32.041
They're here.

284
00:33:35.875 --> 00:33:40.000
- There must be another way out.
- Okay. Go, find it. I'll hold them off.

285
00:33:44.583 --> 00:33:45.625
Come on!

286
00:33:56.708 --> 00:33:57.875
Just you?

287
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.458
The rest is silence.

288
00:34:06.291 --> 00:34:12.750
I remember the first morning I woke up
knowing that Khonshu was gone.

289
00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:17.875
The quiet was liberating.

290
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.875
You're a free man.

291
00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:27.750
And, of course,
with that freedom comes choice.

292
00:34:29.666 --> 00:34:34.083
And right now, you have
a very important decision to make.

293
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.750
Okay.

294
00:35:31.541 --> 00:35:34.166
I can't save anyone
who won't save themselves.

295
00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:54.708
All right, Rosser. It's all right.
Those old bones can't hurt you.

296
00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:02.458
Well, at least now we know what happened
to poor Montalban.

297
00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:06.541
Yes, and to anyone who chooses
a path of greed.

298
00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:12.833
- Does this mean the treasure is gone, too?
- Oh, I think not.

299
00:37:14.375 --> 00:37:16.916
Do you notice anything unusual
about that statue?

300
00:37:17.666 --> 00:37:21.500
The statue of Coyolxauhqui,
lunar god of the Aztecs.

301
00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:24.958
No, but I'm just
a lad trying to do my best.

302
00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:27.375
You're Dr. Steven Grant.

303
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.583
Maybe so, but you've got pluck.

304
00:37:33.458 --> 00:37:35.708
Now, let's see what we can
find on our friend here.

305
00:37:36.708 --> 00:37:41.083
Next one. We've got B-22, everyone.

306
00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:47.708
B-22. Anyone got B-22?
Don't be afraid to speak up.

307
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:51.583
B-22. Come on, everyone.
Don't fall asleep on me now.

308
00:37:51.666 --> 00:37:56.333
It's just getting good. B-22.
I can smell it. We're close to a winner.

309
00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:58.125
How are you doing today, Donna?

310
00:37:58.791 --> 00:38:01.458
Be a bit happier if he
pulled some bloody O's.

311
00:38:01.875 --> 00:38:06.125
Moving on. G-15.
Anyone have a G-15?

312
00:38:06.958 --> 00:38:12.125
G-15? No? Well, 16. Sweet 16-T.

313
00:38:12.208 --> 00:38:14.791
16-T or T-16.

314
00:38:16.125 --> 00:38:17.125
Wow.

315
00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:18.833
Show me. Let me see.

316
00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:24.208
This is beautiful. Very impressive.

317
00:38:25.625 --> 00:38:26.666
Bravo.

318
00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:31.458
Come and have tea with O-73.
No. Moving on.

319
00:38:33.041 --> 00:38:35.666
B-7, anyone? B-7? B-7? B-7?

320
00:38:39.708 --> 00:38:43.750
Right, young man. Brakes are on.
Your favorite spot.

321
00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:52.750
- I changed the movie, okay?
- Huh?

322
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:59.291
It's been five times this week.
It's a lot. Right.

323
00:39:03.916 --> 00:39:07.458
Did I startle you? No.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

324
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:10.458
- I-2. I-2. I-2, anyone?
- Look at that.

325
00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:12.375
- Check your score cards.
- You won.

326
00:39:13.666 --> 00:39:15.333
- I can feel it.
- We won.

327
00:39:15.416 --> 00:39:17.666
Sounds like
you've got a bingo.

328
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.125
- I won.
- We have a winner.

329
00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:24.000
I'll share it with you this time. I swear.

330
00:39:27.166 --> 00:39:28.208
Steven?

331
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.500
Steven?

332
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.166
Steven?

333
00:39:46.041 --> 00:39:48.666
You're all right. Come on. Come on.

334
00:39:49.708 --> 00:39:52.500
There you go. All right.

335
00:39:54.083 --> 00:39:56.333
Marc, you can't keep doing this.

336
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.750
I know that you're having
a great deal of difficulty

337
00:40:16.166 --> 00:40:17.916
being able to differentiate

338
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:21.583
between what's real
and what's in your head.

339
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.791
I hope you don't mind but I took the
liberty of borrowing the film you brought.

340
00:40:29.416 --> 00:40:34.041
It was fun to see that my old
VHS player still worked.

341
00:40:38.041 --> 00:40:43.041
How many times would you say you've
seen that movie? Approximately?

342
00:40:44.541 --> 00:40:45.541
Hmm?

343
00:40:48.666 --> 00:40:50.083
I liked the villain.

344
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:56.333
"No tree can ascend to the light of heaven
if it doesn't descend

345
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.125
"to the depths of hell."

346
00:40:58.791 --> 00:41:03.750
That's a good line. Yeah. The plot makes
a real meal out of a lunar god.

347
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:06.708
And didn't you say that
you worked for one?

348
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.500
Hmm?

349
00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:11.500
What do you make out of that similarity?

350
00:41:11.791 --> 00:41:15.333
I mean,
given the production value of that film,

351
00:41:15.458 --> 00:41:18.166
I can't imagine that
too many other people have seen it.

352
00:41:19.458 --> 00:41:22.625
What do you think? Is that a coincidence?

353
00:41:24.416 --> 00:41:26.791
I don't... I think...

354
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.458
- What?
- I think someone...

355
00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:36.541
- I think someone...
- I know. I'm sorry about that.

356
00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:40.708
But remember, you're only sedated
because of your own behavior.

357
00:41:41.583 --> 00:41:43.583
And the effects will wear off soon.

358
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:50.625
Marc, we don't live in a material world.
We live in a psychic world.

359
00:41:51.666 --> 00:41:56.750
Right? And we're only able
to make indirect inferences

360
00:41:56.875 --> 00:42:03.166
about the nature of reality.
Like, take, for example, this pen, right?

361
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.083
To me, this is a writing utensil. Right?

362
00:42:08.875 --> 00:42:13.291
To my dog, it's a chew toy.
Both are accurate.

363
00:42:14.208 --> 00:42:18.000
Right? It's just a question
of context and perspective.

364
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:25.375
And all I'm asking of you is an honest
assessment of your situation.

365
00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:39.166
Everything reminds me...

366
00:42:41.916 --> 00:42:45.791
- Everything reminds me...
- Reminds you of what?

367
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Hmm?

368
00:42:49.583 --> 00:42:50.708
Of your past?

369
00:42:52.458 --> 00:42:53.625
Of Steven?

370
00:43:00.541 --> 00:43:01.958
You know Steven?

371
00:43:02.666 --> 00:43:07.291
Of course I know Steven.
But, Marc, I wanna talk to you right now.

372
00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:12.208
And I have noticed, all right,
in our sessions, a pattern developing.

373
00:43:12.416 --> 00:43:16.916
Every time I ask you direct questions,
you are triggered, you're overwhelmed,

374
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.208
and that's normal, all right? Many of us,
when asked to look into

375
00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:25.958
our innermost experiences,
into the nucleus of our personality,

376
00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:29.208
we close our eyes. It's understandable.

377
00:43:32.125 --> 00:43:35.125
I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

378
00:43:37.166 --> 00:43:38.166
You shot me.

379
00:43:43.791 --> 00:43:45.000
You shot me.

380
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:51.833
Marc? Marc? Hey. Hey now.
If we can't calmly sit here

381
00:43:53.541 --> 00:43:56.000
and take inventory
of your feelings... Marc.

382
00:43:57.333 --> 00:44:00.083
- Marc, listen. I know...
- No. You stay away from me!

383
00:44:00.375 --> 00:44:03.125
Truly, I understand how you're feeling.

384
00:44:03.958 --> 00:44:09.541
I too have suffered from mental illness,
breaks in psychic awareness,

385
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.625
manic episodes, followed by depression.

386
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:14.958
- I know what you're feeling.
- Unlock the door.

387
00:44:15.083 --> 00:44:16.625
- It can be healed.
- Unlock the door!

388
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:20.083
I know you can be healed.
Marc. Marc, please...

389
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.291
Stay away from me!

390
00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:23.750
Marc, don't do this.
You're only getting...

391
00:44:27.416 --> 00:44:29.875
All right. Be gentle with him.
Don't hurt him. All right?

392
00:44:35.333 --> 00:44:38.208
- You all right? You all right?
- Yeah.

393
00:45:17.583 --> 00:45:18.875
Let me out!

394
00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:22.833
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!
Please! Please, someone let me out!

395
00:45:29.958 --> 00:45:31.000
Steven?

396
00:45:32.916 --> 00:45:34.791
- Marc?
- Steven?

397
00:45:34.875 --> 00:45:35.916
Marc.

398
00:45:43.791 --> 00:45:46.541
- How is this possible?
- I don't know.

399
00:45:47.666 --> 00:45:49.500
What's the last thing that you remember?

400
00:45:50.166 --> 00:45:53.000
- Harrow shot us.
- Yes!

401
00:45:53.583 --> 00:45:56.958
Yes. Exactly. Exactly. All right.

402
00:45:57.208 --> 00:46:00.375
We gotta get out of here.
Follow me. Come on.

403
00:46:35.166 --> 00:46:36.166
Hi.
