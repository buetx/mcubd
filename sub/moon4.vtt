1
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.900
Steven, what did you do?

2
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:16.533
I don't know how to explain
what's been happening.

3
00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.616
- What are you?
- I serve Khonshu. I'm his Avatar.

4
00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:23.575
We protect the vulnerable
and deliver Khonshu's justice.

5
00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:26.741
Khonshu's retribution
comes too late.

6
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:31.241
A mm it will light the path to good
by eradicating the choice of evil.

7
00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:32.366
We found A mm it.

8
00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.783
While the cruel masses
fill this world with sin,

9
00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.700
they deserve to face her judgment.

10
00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:41.259
The other gods? What about them?

11
00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:43.533
They're gonna stand by
let somebody release A mm it?

12
00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:47.158
To signal for an audience
with the gods is to risk their wrath.

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.241
A mm it was buried in secret.
The location hidden even from the gods.

14
00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:54.658
- But someone had to know something.
- One man. A medjay named Senfu.

15
00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:57.825
Find Senfu's sarcophagus
and you'll find your tomb.

16
00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.533
It's a map,
to something really, really big.

17
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.741
Unless we know exactly what
the sky looked like on that date,

18
00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:07.908
we're buggered.

19
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:12.325
When the gods imprison me,
tell Marc to free me.

20
00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:22.950
- Marc?
- I want you to remember one thing.

21
00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:26.658
Your torment forged me.
I owe my victory to you.

22
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.274
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

23
00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:03.450
Steven. Wake up. Come on.
Wake the hell up!

24
00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:22.408
What?

25
00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:44.158
We can't lose more time.
Harrow must be headed back to the tomb.

26
00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.575
Look, if he is,
we're gonna need Marc, yeah?

27
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.033
Exactly. See, she gets it.

28
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.575
- No.
- No?

29
00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:59.325
No. See, the thing is,
we made a deal, Marc and I,

30
00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:03.533
that when he was done with Khonshu,
he would disappear for good.

31
00:06:03.658 --> 00:06:06.991
But that deal didn't involve you getting
Layla and us killed, did it?

32
00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.491
- That's not gonna fly with me.
- You guys made a deal?

33
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.658
That he would just disappear from my life?

34
00:06:14.325 --> 00:06:18.200
And you didn't think that maybe
I should've been made aware of that?

35
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.283
Oh.

36
00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:26.950
Well, hadn't he disappeared
from your life already?

37
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.075
Yeah. I mean, whatever.
His suit was his best feature, wasn't it?

38
00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:34.533
Didn't even have that anymore.

39
00:06:34.616 --> 00:06:38.575
Steven, give me the body right now.
This is a suicide mission.

40
00:06:39.158 --> 00:06:41.575
Plus, I know him.
He'd wanna lone wolf this whole thing.

41
00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:44.075
It's not happening.
We're not gonna do that.

42
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:49.033
We are not. It's just you and me,
and the open road.

43
00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:53.366
- We're gonna go on foot from here.
- Yeah, all right.

44
00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:52.700
There they are. Let's keep moving.

45
00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:55.658
It looks like they're already inside.

46
00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:58.033
We'll need to find another way
to beat them to A mm it.

47
00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:15.116
Hello.

48
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:23.771
Let's check for supplies.

49
00:08:44.408 --> 00:08:46.075
- You look scared.
- I'm not.

50
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:48.116
Well, you should be.

51
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.450
Without Khonshu, there's no more suit,
no more healing, no more power.

52
00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:55.033
Yeah, no more you, I thought.
It's what you said, isn't it?

53
00:08:55.325 --> 00:08:57.741
But believing anything that comes
out of your mouth

54
00:08:57.825 --> 00:08:59.283
just shows what a plonker I am.

55
00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:01.908
Look, I wish I could just disappear.
I really do.

56
00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:03.825
But unfortunately, I'm still here.

57
00:09:04.158 --> 00:09:07.533
If you're gonna go through with this,
you gotta be smart, for Layla's sake.

58
00:09:07.783 --> 00:09:09.908
I've been in situations like this before.

59
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.366
So have I. It's the same body, isn't it?

60
00:09:14.283 --> 00:09:16.616
It's in there somewhere.
Muscle memory and that.

61
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.283
I'm not sure it works that way. Just...

62
00:09:18.366 --> 00:09:20.408
- Whatever.
- I'm here.

63
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.825
- You're not alone.
- I know I'm not alone.

64
00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:25.408
I know I'm bloody not alone.
I've got Layla.

65
00:09:26.408 --> 00:09:28.533
- She's got my back.
- Are you in love?

66
00:09:28.825 --> 00:09:30.033
Are you in love with my wife?

67
00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:33.408
I appreciate your concern, mate.
I really do. But we've got it from here.

68
00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:35.325
I swear to you, Steven. I swear...

69
00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.408
If I need a recipe for a protein shake
or something, I'll call you.

70
00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:39.866
I'll throw us off a cliff!

71
00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:02.741
I have to say, I feel like I've been
waiting for this my whole life.

72
00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:04.700
The adventure, I mean.

73
00:10:06.116 --> 00:10:09.616
- I know. We want what we never had.
- Yeah.

74
00:10:14.908 --> 00:10:16.075
You smell like him.

75
00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:21.075
- I mean, why wouldn't you, right?
- Yeah.

76
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.450
Marc's trying to protect you from Khonshu.

77
00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:28.991
- What?
- That's why he's been pushing you away.

78
00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:33.033
He thinks Khonshu wants you for
his Avatar, and he won't let that happen.

79
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.366
I'm sorry.
I just felt like you should know that.

80
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200
Sorry.

81
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.616
Why are you telling me this now?

82
00:10:45.866 --> 00:10:48.741
I don't know.
I just thought you deserved to know.

83
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.366
Well, it wasn't his call to make.

84
00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:58.241
I don't need protection.
What I need is honesty.

85
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.741
- Yeah. I get that.
- That's more of a "you" thing, isn't it?

86
00:11:06.616 --> 00:11:10.033
What? Being... Honesty?

87
00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:15.116
Yeah. Being honesty.

88
00:11:33.075 --> 00:11:34.116
Yeah.

89
00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:40.283
- I'm gonna go down first.
- Okay. Yeah. Great.

90
00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:44.033
- Before I belay.
- Thank you. What's "belay"?

91
00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:49.241
I still can't tell when
you're joking or not.

92
00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:52.700
All right.

93
00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:01.533
Oh, shit.

94
00:12:23.158 --> 00:12:25.158
- Are you okay?
- I'm aces. Yeah.

95
00:12:28.616 --> 00:12:29.616
Okay.

96
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.616
- Here you go.
- I wish you hadn't seen that.

97
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.908
Yeah. All the years...

98
00:12:34.533 --> 00:12:36.491
Oh, wow, look at you.

99
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.075
Yeah, there's... Gorgeous, aren't they?
They're just, like...

100
00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:48.158
- Been standing guard for centuries.
- Right? Look, I can't even...

101
00:12:51.366 --> 00:12:54.033
Like, if they just sprang
to life right now

102
00:12:54.408 --> 00:12:57.033
and asked me a riddle for passage,
I'd be thrilled.

103
00:12:57.408 --> 00:12:58.908
I'd shit myself but I'd be thrilled.

104
00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:02.991
What's this?

105
00:13:06.325 --> 00:13:07.700
- Did you do that?
- What?

106
00:13:09.116 --> 00:13:13.825
Oh. Yeah. It's for my father.
He would've loved to be here.

107
00:13:14.158 --> 00:13:16.450
Oh, yeah? Big history buff, is he?

108
00:13:16.658 --> 00:13:20.866
So much worse. Archaeologist on a mission.

109
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.241
Cool.

110
00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:31.325
And to him it was a dream
worth dying for. And he did.

111
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:37.575
Um...

112
00:13:37.658 --> 00:13:39.075
I'm so sorry.

113
00:13:39.158 --> 00:13:42.075
- Yeah. No, it's fine, really.
- Yeah.

114
00:13:42.658 --> 00:13:44.866
It's fine. Happens.

115
00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:50.325
I bet that he'd be positively
beaming right now,

116
00:13:50.866 --> 00:13:52.866
seeing you standing in the proof of it.

117
00:13:55.075 --> 00:13:56.908
Yeah. I think so.

118
00:14:00.033 --> 00:14:03.200
Well, it's not such a bad way
to go, is it?

119
00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:07.158
Let's find out?

120
00:14:09.366 --> 00:14:12.116
Yeah. Yeah, let's find out.

121
00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:14.825
It's a nice way to die.

122
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.950
Strange.

123
00:14:28.866 --> 00:14:31.116
- It's a maze.
- It's a-maze-ing.

124
00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:34.325
- No, like, there are six paths.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:40.158
- Right. Six points.
- What would they be shooting at?

126
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.200
This whole structure

127
00:14:57.908 --> 00:14:59.158
is a symbol.

128
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:02.950
- That's the eye of Horus.
- Yeah.

129
00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:06.075
Look at that.

130
00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:07.950
- What?
- Right?

131
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.450
Look, the royal symbol,
protection in the afterlife.

132
00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:14.866
I mean, like, the resources
needed to build this thing.

133
00:15:17.658 --> 00:15:22.200
- Her final Avatar was a pharaoh.
- Whoa! A bloody pharaoh.

134
00:15:22.658 --> 00:15:25.658
- So what? You think it's a map?
- Yeah, well...

135
00:15:26.491 --> 00:15:31.241
Right. So, the eye of Horus
is also the eye of mind, yeah?

136
00:15:31.741 --> 00:15:34.450
Representing the six senses, six points.

137
00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:36.866
So you got the eyebrow
that denotes thoughts.

138
00:15:37.283 --> 00:15:42.200
Pupil, sight, obviously.
This point here is, uh, hearing.

139
00:15:42.616 --> 00:15:48.283
This, smell. Touch.
And this long line ending in a spiral

140
00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:50.866
is the tongue.

141
00:15:53.116 --> 00:15:56.200
The Avatar would be A mm it's voice.

142
00:15:59.075 --> 00:16:00.158
That's right.

143
00:16:25.283 --> 00:16:26.616
Oh, wow.

144
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.700
Oh. Heka priests.

145
00:16:28.908 --> 00:16:31.366
Judging by their masks
and ceremonial stance.

146
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.533
They would've been entombed
in here to protect the pharaoh.

147
00:16:36.408 --> 00:16:37.825
The heck's a Heka?

148
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:41.283
Sorcerers of their time.
They've been down here for centuries.

149
00:16:41.491 --> 00:16:44.408
These must be some of
the unlucky souls who crossed their path.

150
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.408
Right. An impressive send-off.

151
00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:53.616
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Is that fresh blood?

152
00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:56.825
Isn't that little chunks of meaty bits?

153
00:17:01.241 --> 00:17:02.241
Oh.

154
00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:10.658
- Let's keep moving.
- Yeah.

155
00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:12.158
Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:17:13.325 --> 00:17:15.991
Um, just a minute. Just a minute.

157
00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:23.950
I'm just saying what I see, and I see lots
of bones and blood going that way.

158
00:17:24.658 --> 00:17:29.575
So I'm just thinking, like,
what if there's maybe another...

159
00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.783
There's, like, another...

160
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.866
There's an opening up there. You see that?

161
00:17:36.283 --> 00:17:37.450
Yeah.

162
00:17:37.533 --> 00:17:38.950
- Should we check it out?
- Yeah.

163
00:17:39.033 --> 00:17:40.575
- All right.
- All right. You go.

164
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.700
- Me?
- You.

165
00:17:41.783 --> 00:17:43.075
Yeah, all right. Yeah.

166
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.616
- I did it. I'm up.
- You good?

167
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.700
Yeah.

168
00:17:56.908 --> 00:18:02.033
So, according to the ancient texts,
A mm it should be bound to an ushabti,

169
00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:03.658
statue thingies.

170
00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:09.075
- How's it looking?
- It's looking amazing.

171
00:18:10.158 --> 00:18:15.616
I mean, this... It looks like a freshly
filled canopic jar, and snake skins,

172
00:18:16.158 --> 00:18:17.908
- and self-regeneration...
- Steven?

173
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.283
- Steven?
- Yeah?

174
00:18:20.241 --> 00:18:21.241
The exit.

175
00:18:27.533 --> 00:18:29.700
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we can go this way.

176
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.783
- Harrow.
- What are they shooting at?

177
00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.116
I don't know.

178
00:18:40.783 --> 00:18:42.033
Hide. Hide.

179
00:20:38.241 --> 00:20:40.616
Run! I'll find you!

180
00:20:45.575 --> 00:20:48.241
I squished it. I squished it.

181
00:21:18.991 --> 00:21:19.991
Steven?

182
00:24:34.658 --> 00:24:36.116
Oh, my days.

183
00:24:38.158 --> 00:24:42.158
First one in. Tomb fit for a pharaoh.

184
00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:45.116
Thutmose II.

185
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.533
Nefertiti.
Oh, it's gotta be one of the big'uns.

186
00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:53.991
So, you kissed her.

187
00:24:57.991 --> 00:24:59.991
What are you gonna do?
Try and drown us now?

188
00:25:00.283 --> 00:25:01.491
Yeah, I should.

189
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.700
But you also told her the truth
about why I've been pushing her away.

190
00:25:07.575 --> 00:25:09.075
And that was unexpected.

191
00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.075
Yeah.

192
00:25:12.158 --> 00:25:14.825
Wow. Look at that.
Look at all these relics.

193
00:25:16.825 --> 00:25:18.325
Macedonian? No. What?

194
00:25:19.783 --> 00:25:23.200
No way. That's not right.
That can't be right. That's Macedonian.

195
00:25:24.158 --> 00:25:25.700
But the only pharaoh...

196
00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:29.283
But, I mean, he insisted
on calling himself Egyptian.

197
00:25:31.366 --> 00:25:32.450
But...

198
00:25:38.075 --> 00:25:43.783
I think we're looking
at the long-lost tomb

199
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.533
of Alexander the Great.

200
00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:01.241
You handled that beautifully.

201
00:26:03.575 --> 00:26:04.991
Why do all men like you

202
00:26:06.408 --> 00:26:11.783
feel it necessary to be
just so condescending?

203
00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:21.866
My little scarab.

204
00:26:23.116 --> 00:26:25.366
Isn't that what your father
used to call you?

205
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.241
Abdullah El-Faouly.

206
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:34.533
One of Egypt's most unique archaeologists.

207
00:26:38.283 --> 00:26:40.533
He would be so proud of you

208
00:26:42.158 --> 00:26:44.991
if he knew that you were among the first

209
00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.408
to confirm for the world
what he always believed.

210
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.450
Egyptian gods walk among us.

211
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.241
The scales

212
00:27:01.575 --> 00:27:07.408
achieve their judgment by revealing
to me moments of sin and pain.

213
00:27:08.908 --> 00:27:10.241
And your husband...

214
00:27:11.908 --> 00:27:14.200
He is in agony.

215
00:27:14.991 --> 00:27:17.825
More pain than anyone could bear.

216
00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:20.908
But he still hasn't told you the truth.

217
00:27:21.783 --> 00:27:23.700
Well, you're obviously dying to.

218
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.491
So why don't you just go ahead?
The floor is yours.

219
00:27:33.825 --> 00:27:34.991
I read his scales.

220
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.158
The scales do not lie.

221
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:49.491
Everything inside me is
screaming not to open this thing.

222
00:27:49.616 --> 00:27:52.658
You want Harrow
to get to A mm it first?

223
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:54.200
All right, all right, all right.

224
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.241
Oh, man.

225
00:28:17.158 --> 00:28:19.658
- Where's the ushabti?
- Well...

226
00:28:19.991 --> 00:28:23.700
If you're gonna hide it for all eternity,
you'd probably put it in a place where

227
00:28:23.866 --> 00:28:25.741
the average looter wouldn't think to look.

228
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.325
So what do you think?

229
00:28:30.116 --> 00:28:31.116
Um...

230
00:28:36.575 --> 00:28:39.158
Alexander was the voice of A mm it.

231
00:28:44.658 --> 00:28:47.783
All right. I'm gonna try something.
I'll do something here.

232
00:28:50.116 --> 00:28:54.283
Sorry. Oh, God. So sorry.
Sorry, Mr. Great.

233
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:06.075
All right. Open up. Sorry, Mr. Great.

234
00:29:07.325 --> 00:29:08.991
Sorry. I couldn't be more sorry.

235
00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:13.616
Ugh! Ew!

236
00:29:14.366 --> 00:29:17.533
Yeah, that's it. Get in there.
Reach in there, buddy.

237
00:29:17.783 --> 00:29:18.783
Oh...

238
00:29:23.283 --> 00:29:26.116
Your father was murdered
by mercenaries.

239
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.575
And no one knows who they were, do they?

240
00:29:31.991 --> 00:29:35.616
You're saying that Marc was one of them?

241
00:29:36.533 --> 00:29:40.033
You said it. What do you think?

242
00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:48.783
Marc remembers everything
that happened that day.

243
00:29:49.616 --> 00:29:51.783
Everyone who died.

244
00:29:53.991 --> 00:29:55.616
But one man stands out.

245
00:29:57.241 --> 00:30:01.325
Man with a fuchsia scarf.

246
00:30:02.783 --> 00:30:04.116
Scarab details.

247
00:30:05.575 --> 00:30:08.991
Handmade. Made by his daughter perhaps.

248
00:30:18.241 --> 00:30:19.241
Are you done?

249
00:30:29.158 --> 00:30:30.825
I do hope you find closure.

250
00:30:36.616 --> 00:30:37.700
Wake up!

251
00:30:43.491 --> 00:30:45.866
Sir, we just found another way.

252
00:31:05.241 --> 00:31:07.491
Layla, look. We won.

253
00:31:10.616 --> 00:31:13.200
And the ushabti goes to us.

254
00:31:14.616 --> 00:31:18.575
I had to go digging down old Alexander
the Great's gullet, but I found it.

255
00:31:22.491 --> 00:31:23.533
You all right, love?

256
00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:26.366
Can he hear me?

257
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.825
Alexander? I don't think so.
God, I hope not.

258
00:31:30.575 --> 00:31:33.325
What happened to my father?

259
00:31:35.825 --> 00:31:37.450
- I'm talking to you.
- What?

260
00:31:38.408 --> 00:31:39.450
I'm talking to you, Marc!

261
00:31:46.075 --> 00:31:47.700
- Come on. Let's go, let's go.
- No.

262
00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:50.075
- We need to go right now.
- Marc, no. No.

263
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:52.866
- What happened to my father?
- Listen to me.

264
00:31:53.283 --> 00:31:57.116
We need to leave right now. I will explain
everything, I swear. But we have to go.

265
00:31:57.283 --> 00:32:00.700
Did you kill Abdullah El-Faouly?

266
00:32:01.658 --> 00:32:05.158
Of course not. Of course I didn't.

267
00:32:12.325 --> 00:32:13.450
But you were there.

268
00:32:14.991 --> 00:32:16.575
- You were there.
- I...

269
00:32:17.325 --> 00:32:18.658
Yeah, you were there.

270
00:32:20.491 --> 00:32:23.450
I was there. Yeah, I was there.

271
00:32:24.491 --> 00:32:29.491
Yeah. And how did he die?

272
00:32:37.741 --> 00:32:39.366
My partner got greedy

273
00:32:41.616 --> 00:32:43.491
and he executed everyone at the dig site.

274
00:32:46.241 --> 00:32:50.325
I tried to save your father,
but I couldn't save him. And I...

275
00:32:52.658 --> 00:32:57.908
No. But you brought
a killer right to him. Right?

276
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.241
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

277
00:33:01.325 --> 00:33:03.366
He shot me too.
I was supposed to die that night.

278
00:33:04.116 --> 00:33:07.533
But I didn't die that night.
And I should have.

279
00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:13.033
I've tried to tell you
since the moment we met.

280
00:33:14.408 --> 00:33:17.533
- I just didn't know...
- Oh, my God.

281
00:33:22.658 --> 00:33:24.741
That's the reason that we met.

282
00:33:27.783 --> 00:33:29.783
You just had a guilty conscience.

283
00:33:34.241 --> 00:33:35.241
They're here.

284
00:33:39.075 --> 00:33:43.200
- There must be another way out.
- Okay. Go, find it. I'll hold them off.

285
00:33:47.783 --> 00:33:48.825
Come on!

286
00:33:59.908 --> 00:34:01.075
Just you?

287
00:34:06.241 --> 00:34:07.658
The rest is silence.

288
00:34:09.491 --> 00:34:15.950
I remember the first morning I woke up
knowing that Khonshu was gone.

289
00:34:17.533 --> 00:34:21.075
The quiet was liberating.

290
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:24.075
You're a free man.

291
00:34:26.533 --> 00:34:30.950
And, of course,
with that freedom comes choice.

292
00:34:32.866 --> 00:34:37.283
And right now, you have
a very important decision to make.

293
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:45.950
Okay.

294
00:35:34.741 --> 00:35:37.366
I can't save anyone
who won't save themselves.

295
00:36:53.616 --> 00:36:57.908
All right, Rosser. It's all right.
Those old bones can't hurt you.

296
00:37:02.116 --> 00:37:05.658
Well, at least now we know what happened
to poor Montalban.

297
00:37:06.033 --> 00:37:09.741
Yes, and to anyone who chooses
a path of greed.

298
00:37:12.533 --> 00:37:16.033
- Does this mean the treasure is gone, too?
- Oh, I think not.

299
00:37:17.575 --> 00:37:20.116
Do you notice anything unusual
about that statue?

300
00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:24.700
The statue of Coyolxauhqui,
lunar god of the Aztecs.

301
00:37:25.658 --> 00:37:28.158
No, but I'm just
a lad trying to do my best.

302
00:37:28.616 --> 00:37:30.575
You're Dr. Steven Grant.

303
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.783
Maybe so, but you've got pluck.

304
00:37:36.658 --> 00:37:38.908
Now, let's see what we can
find on our friend here.

305
00:37:39.908 --> 00:37:44.283
Next one. We've got B-22, everyone.

306
00:37:47.033 --> 00:37:50.908
B-22. Anyone got B-22?
Don't be afraid to speak up.

307
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.783
B-22. Come on, everyone.
Don't fall asleep on me now.

308
00:37:54.866 --> 00:37:59.533
It's just getting good. B-22.
I can smell it. We're close to a winner.

309
00:37:59.908 --> 00:38:01.325
How are you doing today, Donna?

310
00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:04.658
Be a bit happier if he
pulled some bloody O's.

311
00:38:05.075 --> 00:38:09.325
Moving on. G-15.
Anyone have a G-15?

312
00:38:10.158 --> 00:38:15.325
G-15? No? Well, 16. Sweet 16-T.

313
00:38:15.408 --> 00:38:17.991
16-T or T-16.

314
00:38:19.325 --> 00:38:20.325
Wow.

315
00:38:20.783 --> 00:38:22.033
Show me. Let me see.

316
00:38:23.991 --> 00:38:27.408
This is beautiful. Very impressive.

317
00:38:28.825 --> 00:38:29.866
Bravo.

318
00:38:31.033 --> 00:38:34.658
Come and have tea with O-73.
No. Moving on.

319
00:38:36.241 --> 00:38:38.866
B-7, anyone? B-7? B-7? B-7?

320
00:38:42.908 --> 00:38:46.950
Right, young man. Brakes are on.
Your favorite spot.

321
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:55.950
- I changed the movie, okay?
- Huh?

322
00:38:57.991 --> 00:39:02.491
It's been five times this week.
It's a lot. Right.

323
00:39:07.116 --> 00:39:10.658
Did I startle you? No.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

324
00:39:10.741 --> 00:39:13.658
- I-2. I-2. I-2, anyone?
- Look at that.

325
00:39:13.783 --> 00:39:15.575
- Check your score cards.
- You won.

326
00:39:16.866 --> 00:39:18.533
- I can feel it.
- We won.

327
00:39:18.616 --> 00:39:20.866
Sounds like
you've got a bingo.

328
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.325
- I won.
- We have a winner.

329
00:39:25.075 --> 00:39:27.200
I'll share it with you this time. I swear.

330
00:39:30.366 --> 00:39:31.408
Steven?

331
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.700
Steven?

332
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.366
Steven?

333
00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:51.866
You're all right. Come on. Come on.

334
00:39:52.908 --> 00:39:55.700
There you go. All right.

335
00:39:57.283 --> 00:39:59.533
Marc, you can't keep doing this.

336
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.950
I know that you're having
a great deal of difficulty

337
00:40:19.366 --> 00:40:21.116
being able to differentiate

338
00:40:21.616 --> 00:40:24.783
between what's real
and what's in your head.

339
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:31.991
I hope you don't mind but I took the
liberty of borrowing the film you brought.

340
00:40:32.616 --> 00:40:37.241
It was fun to see that my old
VHS player still worked.

341
00:40:41.241 --> 00:40:46.241
How many times would you say you've
seen that movie? Approximately?

342
00:40:47.741 --> 00:40:48.741
Hmm?

343
00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:53.283
I liked the villain.

344
00:40:54.991 --> 00:40:59.533
"No tree can ascend to the light of heaven
if it doesn't descend

345
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.325
"to the depths of hell."

346
00:41:01.991 --> 00:41:06.950
That's a good line. Yeah. The plot makes
a real meal out of a lunar god.

347
00:41:07.741 --> 00:41:09.908
And didn't you say that
you worked for one?

348
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700
Hmm?

349
00:41:12.866 --> 00:41:14.700
What do you make out of that similarity?

350
00:41:14.991 --> 00:41:18.533
I mean,
given the production value of that film,

351
00:41:18.658 --> 00:41:21.366
I can't imagine that
too many other people have seen it.

352
00:41:22.658 --> 00:41:25.825
What do you think? Is that a coincidence?

353
00:41:27.616 --> 00:41:29.991
I don't... I think...

354
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.658
- What?
- I think someone...

355
00:41:35.908 --> 00:41:39.741
- I think someone...
- I know. I'm sorry about that.

356
00:41:40.533 --> 00:41:43.908
But remember, you're only sedated
because of your own behavior.

357
00:41:44.783 --> 00:41:46.783
And the effects will wear off soon.

358
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:53.825
Marc, we don't live in a material world.
We live in a psychic world.

359
00:41:54.866 --> 00:41:59.950
Right? And we're only able
to make indirect inferences

360
00:42:00.075 --> 00:42:06.366
about the nature of reality.
Like, take, for example, this pen, right?

361
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.283
To me, this is a writing utensil. Right?

362
00:42:12.075 --> 00:42:16.491
To my dog, it's a chew toy.
Both are accurate.

363
00:42:17.408 --> 00:42:21.200
Right? It's just a question
of context and perspective.

364
00:42:22.991 --> 00:42:28.575
And all I'm asking of you is an honest
assessment of your situation.

365
00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:42.366
Everything reminds me...

366
00:42:45.116 --> 00:42:48.991
- Everything reminds me...
- Reminds you of what?

367
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.200
Hmm?

368
00:42:52.783 --> 00:42:53.908
Of your past?

369
00:42:55.658 --> 00:42:56.825
Of Steven?

370
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:05.158
You know Steven?

371
00:43:05.866 --> 00:43:10.491
Of course I know Steven.
But, Marc, I wanna talk to you right now.

372
00:43:10.783 --> 00:43:15.408
And I have noticed, all right,
in our sessions, a pattern developing.

373
00:43:15.616 --> 00:43:20.116
Every time I ask you direct questions,
you are triggered, you're overwhelmed,

374
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.408
and that's normal, all right? Many of us,
when asked to look into

375
00:43:24.616 --> 00:43:29.158
our innermost experiences,
into the nucleus of our personality,

376
00:43:29.241 --> 00:43:32.408
we close our eyes. It's understandable.

377
00:43:35.325 --> 00:43:38.325
I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

378
00:43:40.366 --> 00:43:41.366
You shot me.

379
00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:48.200
You shot me.

380
00:43:49.616 --> 00:43:55.033
Marc? Marc? Hey. Hey now.
If we can't calmly sit here

381
00:43:56.741 --> 00:43:59.200
and take inventory
of your feelings... Marc.

382
00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:03.283
- Marc, listen. I know...
- No. You stay away from me!

383
00:44:03.575 --> 00:44:06.325
Truly, I understand how you're feeling.

384
00:44:07.158 --> 00:44:12.741
I too have suffered from mental illness,
breaks in psychic awareness,

385
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.825
manic episodes, followed by depression.

386
00:44:16.241 --> 00:44:18.158
- I know what you're feeling.
- Unlock the door.

387
00:44:18.283 --> 00:44:19.825
- It can be healed.
- Unlock the door!

388
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:23.283
I know you can be healed.
Marc. Marc, please...

389
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:24.491
Stay away from me!

390
00:44:24.825 --> 00:44:26.950
Marc, don't do this.
You're only getting...

391
00:44:30.616 --> 00:44:33.075
All right. Be gentle with him.
Don't hurt him. All right?

392
00:44:38.533 --> 00:44:41.408
- You all right? You all right?
- Yeah.

393
00:45:20.783 --> 00:45:22.075
Let me out!

394
00:45:22.158 --> 00:45:26.033
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!
Please! Please, someone let me out!

395
00:45:33.158 --> 00:45:34.200
Steven?

396
00:45:36.116 --> 00:45:37.991
- Marc?
- Steven?

397
00:45:38.075 --> 00:45:39.116
Marc.

398
00:45:46.991 --> 00:45:49.741
- How is this possible?
- I don't know.

399
00:45:50.866 --> 00:45:52.700
What's the last thing that you remember?

400
00:45:53.366 --> 00:45:56.200
- Harrow shot us.
- Yes!

401
00:45:56.783 --> 00:46:00.158
Yes. Exactly. Exactly. All right.

402
00:46:00.408 --> 00:46:03.575
We gotta get out of here.
Follow me. Come on.

403
00:46:38.366 --> 00:46:39.366
Hi.
