- I'm Yatzil, Avatar of Hathor.
- Okay.

Surely Khonshu mentioned her?

Well, as far as I know, the only melody
Khonshu enjoys is the sound of pain.

Not really.
Is there somethin' I should know?

to hear the account of Khonshu.

211
00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:59.291
You've been banished once
for nearly exposing us, Khonshu.

212

(AS KHONSHU) Spare me

We need the might of gods.

Return from the opulence of the Overvoid
before you lose this realm.

For the last time, Khonshu...

The Avatars that remain here
are simply meant to observe.

228

we did not wish to meddle

The charges?

Conspiracy to release Ammit!

235
00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:15.458
That is a heavy accusation, Khonshu.

00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:42.666

must be nefarious.

the sound of that voice.

from her tomb?

would be longer than the Nile.

249

by jealousy, paranoia, and his...

because you know that if you do,

00:36:21.458 --> 00:36:24.083
So, it's not true?
What he said about you and...

529
00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:25.333
No, it's not true.

530
00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:29.250
No, he's just trying to divide us.
Don't let him get in your head.

531
00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:31.583
Every time I learn something new
about you,

532
00:36:31.708 --> 00:36:37.291
I think, "That's it. There can't possibly
be any secrets left between us."

533
00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:43.208
And then something else pops up,
and it's like I've not known you at all.

534
00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:45.958
Yeah. You haven't.

535
00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:49.083
You don't.

536
00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:06.500
DISCIPLE: I've spotted them.

537
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:36.041
MARC: Try that.

538
00:37:37.458 --> 00:37:38.583
LAYLA: Maybe, actually.

539
00:37:39.583 --> 00:37:40.833
MARC: This one?
LAYLA: Okay.

540
00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:44.625
Uh... No. Anything else?

541
00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:50.333
I'm not getting any whole constellations.
It's just little pieces and fragments.

542
00:37:51.583 --> 00:37:52.791
(SIGHS)

543
00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:58.500
This is gonna take forever.

544
00:38:01.875 --> 00:38:04.833
- Marc, we need Steven.
- (SIGHS WEARILY)

545
00:38:07.041 --> 00:38:10.291
He understands all of this. I really think
it's worth giving him a shot.

546
00:38:12.958 --> 00:38:15.958
KHONSHU: I summon the gods,
you summon the worm.

547
00:38:16.041 --> 00:38:18.750
He won't return the body.

548
00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:22.333
LAYLA: Marc, we can't wait.
It's okay, just let go.

549
00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:23.736
- (EXCLAIMS)
- We don't have time.

550
00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:26.583
(SIGHS)

551
00:38:28.208 --> 00:38:29.208
What are you doing?

552
00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:34.375
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

553
00:38:39.708 --> 00:38:41.541
All right, go ahead. You're in.

554
00:38:45.916 --> 00:38:47.236
(AS STEVEN) Cheers, thanks a lot.

555
00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:49.875
All right. Yeah.

556
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:57.208
Here we go.

557
00:39:02.125 --> 00:39:03.791
Don't need that.

558
00:39:03.916 --> 00:39:05.208
I don't need that.

559
00:39:07.458 --> 00:39:08.458
Steven?

560
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.250
Egyptians invented modern navigation.

561
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.208
There's not a lot of landmarks
in the desert.

562
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:26.125
So they came up with a way
to get about using the sun and the stars.

563
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:27.791
It's bloody genius, isn't it?

564
00:39:28.041 --> 00:39:29.041
Yeah.

565
00:39:30.291 --> 00:39:31.666
Et voilà.

566
00:39:32.541 --> 00:39:33.791
LAYLA: Whoa.

567
00:39:35.833 --> 00:39:36.833
It's French.

568
00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.833
(LAUGHS) I know.

569
00:39:44.666 --> 00:39:45.958
So, what do we do with it?

570
00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:52.708
Well, I'm not sure, but if...

571
00:39:53.166 --> 00:39:54.416
Wait, hang on a minute.

572
00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:58.375
You see that?
You see those little pinpricks there?

573
00:39:58.458 --> 00:39:59.791
That's a constellation.

574
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.920
LAYLA: We should be able to triangulate
the stars into coordinates, right?

575
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.166
Let me just scan it.

576
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.708
Well, um, actually...
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

577
00:40:09.416 --> 00:40:12.375
- Not working. Why isn't it working?
- Yeah, yeah, you see, Senfu...

578
00:40:12.458 --> 00:40:16.875
Senfu marked that tomb,
like, 2,000 years ago.

579
00:40:17.166 --> 00:40:20.583
And stars drift over time.
Not much as far as stars go,

580
00:40:20.666 --> 00:40:23.583
but it could mean the difference
between us searching miles away

581
00:40:23.666 --> 00:40:25.458
from where we're supposed to be looking.

582
00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:29.708
So unless we know exactly
what the sky looked like on that date,

583
00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:32.166
we're buggered.

584
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.916
KHONSHU: I remember that night.

585
00:40:36.458 --> 00:40:38.458
I remember every night.

586
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.041
STEVEN: Khonshu?

587
00:41:05.708 --> 00:41:09.000
KHONSHU: I can turn back the night sky.

588
00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:12.208
- How?
- It will come at a cost,

589
00:41:12.291 --> 00:41:14.750
and I cannot do it alone.

590
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.958
Steven, when the gods imprison me,

591
00:41:25.041 --> 00:41:26.875
tell Marc to free me.

592
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.416
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

593
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.000
Do what I do.

594
00:41:46.166 --> 00:41:48.458
STEVEN: Yeah? Like this?

595
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:52.125
- (KHONSHU GROANS)
- Whoa!

596
00:41:56.416 --> 00:41:58.458
Oh, man! This is mental.

597
00:41:59.833 --> 00:42:01.625

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

600
00:42:32.916 --> 00:42:35.208
KHONSHU: This is the night.

601

(RUMBLING)

602
00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:39.416
STEVEN: This is surprisingly painful.

603
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.500
LAYLA: It's working.

604
00:42:40.833 --> 00:42:42.166
STEVEN: It's working. Yes.

605
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:43.750
Good.

606
00:42:43.833 --> 00:42:45.333
(GROANING)

607
00:42:49.583 --> 00:42:51.958
You brought this upon yourself, Khonshu.

(STEVEN GROANS)

610
00:43:04.375 --> 00:43:06.833
STEVEN: I can feel my energy leaving me.

611
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.333
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

612
00:43:24.125 --> 00:43:26.375
Oh, God, I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

29 degrees north, 25 east.

(LAYLA GRUNTS)

619
00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.666
Hey, Steven? Marc?

620
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.666
Come on. Come on.

621
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:09.750
Where are you?

622
00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:12.000
Marc? Come on.

623
00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:20.375
SELIM: You were right about Khonshu.

624
00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:25.541
And in the end, he left us no choice.

625
00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:36.125
Now, he's tethered to this place,

626
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:40.458
like many before him.

627
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.291
Can he hear us?

628
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:47.333
We think so, yes.

629

ARTHUR: Can I tell you a secret?

630
00:45:14.333 --> 00:45:18.541
I enjoyed dealing out pain on your behalf.

631
00:45:20.708 --> 00:45:23.000
That is the greatest sin I carry.

632
00:45:27.083 --> 00:45:28.291
I am grateful.

633
00:45:29.916 --> 00:45:32.458
Had you not broken me so completely,

634
00:45:33.375 --> 00:45:36.083
I might never have known
the value of healing.

635
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.125
I'm going to do what you could not.

636
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:52.625
And when it's finished,

637
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:55.666
I want you to remember one thing.

638
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.750
Your torment forged me.

639
00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:01.375
I owe my victory to you.
