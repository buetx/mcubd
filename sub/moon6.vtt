1
00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:09.295
Do you swear to protect
the travelers of the night?

2
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.711
We're dead?

3
00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:17.253
It's the hearts.
They aren't full.

4
00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:21.461
Can you send word to Layla?
Please, help us free Khonshu.

5
00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:26.295
Trust me when I tell you
there's always one last thing.

6
00:00:26.378 --> 00:00:27.938
We could've handled it together.

7
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:29.503
That's not really what I do, is it?

8
00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:33.795
Do you think that is sense or nonsense?

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.045
I'm going to do
what you could not.

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.461
Then when it's finished,
and the world is cleansed of abusers,

11
00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:42.753
I want you to remember one thing.

12
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.420
Your torment forged me.

13
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.503
I owe my victory to you.

14
00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:51.503
Marc, you've got this.

15
00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:55.336
But if I'm you,
it means I've got this too.

16
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.336
Steven!

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

18
00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:36.170
I'm sorry it had to be this way,
Marc Spector,

19
00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:39.503
Steven Grant,

20
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.295
whoever else might be in there.

21
00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:51.170
Sometimes we need the cold light of death
before we can see reality.

22
00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.503
Who wants to heal the world?

23
00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:02.545
Marc. Marc.

24
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.890
It's all right.
It's all right.

25
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.003
It's all right. It's all right.

26
00:05:47.336 --> 00:05:48.336
Show me your papers.

27
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:50.821
I don't need to show you my papers.

28
00:05:50.878 --> 00:05:52.420
You need to show us your soul.

29
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.836
This is the face of a good man.

30
00:06:23.003 --> 00:06:24.295
You don't need this anymore.

31
00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:27.420
Move the bodies out of the way.

32
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.086
Let's go! Clear a path.

33
00:06:53.836 --> 00:06:55.276
Don't do it.

34
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.086
Layla, wait. I am the Goddess Taweret.

35
00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:06.336
Layla,

36
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:08.920
it's Marc who's telling you to stop.

37
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:10.211
What the hell is this?

38
00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:13.336
He's dead.

39
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.086
And I'm talking to you through dead people
right now. So what?

40
00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:19.711
Listen, Harrow is too powerful for you
to stop him alone.

41
00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:20.795
If Marc...

42
00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:23.211
If he can return to life...

43
00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:25.961
What do you mean, "return to life"?

44
00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:33.586
He is going to need Khonshu.

45
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.920
Break his ushabti.

46
00:07:36.253 --> 00:07:37.711
It's in the Chamber of the Gods.

47
00:07:38.628 --> 00:07:40.170
And you can be my Avatar.

48
00:07:40.878 --> 00:07:42.586
Marc says wonderful things about you.

49
00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:44.711
No, no, no. I'll fight him on my own.

50
00:07:44.795 --> 00:07:45.795
It's time to go!

51
00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:22.961
The disturbance.

52
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.545
Your Gods felt it too.

53
00:08:24.628 --> 00:08:25.628
But what does it mean?

54
00:08:25.836 --> 00:08:28.586
Someone is trying to release A mm it.

55
00:08:29.253 --> 00:08:31.128
But why?

56
00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.420
Harrow.

57
00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:39.878
Come. You won't believe
what the Gods have hidden from mankind.

58
00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.253
You're judges, not warriors.

59
00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:53.836
This doesn't need to happen.

60
00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:13.253
This was all so avoidable.

61
00:09:58.586 --> 00:10:01.378
To whom do I owe my gratitude?

62
00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:04.003
Your humble disciple, my Goddess,

63
00:10:04.628 --> 00:10:06.378
to whom you owe nothing.

64
00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:08.836
Your Scales lack balance.

65
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.295
I understand.

66
00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:18.253
I had hoped my penance
might correct my imbalance,

67
00:10:18.378 --> 00:10:20.170
but I see now that's impossible.

68
00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:24.211
I accept the Scales
regardless of the outcome.

69
00:10:24.503 --> 00:10:27.420
They lack balance
because of what lies ahead of you.

70
00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:30.836
Then we must spare the world
the pain I will cause.

71
00:10:32.878 --> 00:10:34.211
I willingly submit.

72
00:10:34.295 --> 00:10:37.253
What lies ahead of you
is your service to me.

73
00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:40.128
How may I serve you in death?

74
00:10:40.378 --> 00:10:42.003
Your death is delayed.

75
00:10:42.795 --> 00:10:46.795
I once relied on a servant
whose Scales balanced perfectly.

76
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:51.545
In exchange,
I was bound to stone for 2,000 years.

77
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.836
But I have disciples
all over the world

78
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.295
whose Scales balance perfectly,
awaiting your command.

79
00:10:58.336 --> 00:11:01.170
They are worthy, my Goddess.

80
00:11:01.253 --> 00:11:03.503
But you are the one who set me free.

81
00:11:03.586 --> 00:11:06.045
You are the Avatar that I need.

82
00:11:06.586 --> 00:11:09.795
Serve me, and you will find peace.

83
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.336
Do not let the pain
of the past control you.

84
00:11:21.086 --> 00:11:22.170
As you wish.

85
00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:36.253
I do not sense
Marc Spector in this world.

86
00:11:37.336 --> 00:11:39.753
He died fighting, no doubt.

87
00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:42.128
Fighting your war.

88
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.878
And it's far from over.

89
00:11:43.961 --> 00:11:47.711
If Marc is truly gone,
I am in need of an Avatar.

90
00:11:47.795 --> 00:11:51.670
Would you, Layla El-Faouly,
protect the travelers of the night...

91
00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.045
Are you joking?

92
00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:57.586
You turned Marc's life
into a waking nightmare.

93
00:11:58.461 --> 00:12:00.170
Why would I ever sign up for that?

94
00:12:00.378 --> 00:12:04.336
Because you won't win
against Harrow and A mm it alone.

95
00:12:04.878 --> 00:12:06.170
I'll take my chances.

96
00:12:06.253 --> 00:12:08.670
Marc was in crisis over you.

97
00:12:08.753 --> 00:12:11.420
His lack of focus got him killed.

98
00:12:11.503 --> 00:12:15.128
You need a plan, little bug.
What I offer...

99
00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:18.003
I don't care what you can offer.

100
00:12:20.003 --> 00:12:21.795
Marc didn't trust you.

101
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.461
I don't trust you.

102
00:12:28.003 --> 00:12:32.503
We'll work together
without me enslaving myself.

103
00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:36.003
We must rebind A mm it.

104
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:37.461
How?

105
00:12:37.795 --> 00:12:40.128
Only an Avatar can do it.

106
00:12:40.878 --> 00:12:42.836
I said "no."

107
00:12:45.295 --> 00:12:49.836
Let us purify the souls of Cairo
and then the world.

108
00:13:00.295 --> 00:13:03.378
Khonshu. Time has been cruel to you.

109
00:13:03.711 --> 00:13:06.795
Indeed.
I cannot allow you to proceed.

110
00:13:07.045 --> 00:13:09.711
There's someone else here.
Find who released him.

111
00:13:18.253 --> 00:13:19.586
The Scales are balanced.

112
00:13:20.586 --> 00:13:21.961
Your heart is full.

113
00:13:24.545 --> 00:13:27.003
Your journey is over.

114
00:13:31.586 --> 00:13:34.336
It's so...

115
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.503
quiet.

116
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.878
The peace you've always wanted
but never had.

117
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.086
You're manifesting it.

118
00:13:41.545 --> 00:13:45.628
No danger. No loneliness or hurt.

119
00:13:46.461 --> 00:13:47.586
What about Steven?

120
00:13:48.336 --> 00:13:51.211
He's gone, Marc. The Duat has him.

121
00:13:52.003 --> 00:13:54.211
Please enjoy your peace.

122
00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:06.628
We need to go back for him.

123
00:14:09.711 --> 00:14:11.170
It doesn't work like that.

124
00:14:11.628 --> 00:14:13.878
Leave here, and you can't return.

125
00:14:15.045 --> 00:14:18.420
Anyway, you don't need him anymore, Marc.

126
00:14:18.586 --> 00:14:21.128
So I get to go on to eternal peace,
and he just...

127
00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:23.711
stays lost in the sand forever?

128
00:14:28.461 --> 00:14:29.628
No, I'm not good with that.

129
00:14:30.753 --> 00:14:32.836
Wait! Think about this!

130
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.920
My path is set, same as anyone's.

131
00:14:57.045 --> 00:14:58.961
I'm here to bring balance.

132
00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:02.378
You speak of balance,
yet you choose him.

133
00:15:02.503 --> 00:15:03.920
Your Avatar is a sinner!

134
00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:05.586
You're jealous of his loyalty.

135
00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:07.045
Loyalty at what cost?

136
00:15:07.128 --> 00:15:10.128
An empty world
for your disciples to inherit?

137
00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:13.586
Don't listen to him.
He only wants to keep you bound.

138
00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:29.961
Steven.

139
00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:34.336
Looking pretty rough, man.

140
00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:38.616
I don't know if you can hear me.

141
00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:41.961
From the moment you arrived,

142
00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:45.711
way back then, we were so young.

143
00:15:47.295 --> 00:15:48.295
You saved me.

144
00:15:51.253 --> 00:15:53.336
I survived because I knew I wasn't alone.

145
00:15:54.878 --> 00:15:58.378
You were always there,
alive, full of hope.

146
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:02.086
And I tried to protect that, and I failed.
I couldn't protect you.

147
00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:12.586
- But you didn't abandon me.
- You didn't abandon me.

148
00:16:13.253 --> 00:16:15.836
And although that field back there
was looking...

149
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.545
It was looking pretty good...

150
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.336
There's no way in hell
I'm gonna abandon you.

151
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.711
You are the only real superpower...

152
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.753
I ever had.

153
00:17:07.503 --> 00:17:08.503
Marc.

154
00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:11.961
Steven.

155
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.045
You came back?
What the hell's wrong with you?

156
00:17:21.295 --> 00:17:23.211
Well, I did a whole little speech there.

157
00:17:23.336 --> 00:17:24.536
It wasn't that little.

158
00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:28.795
Marc, look. The Gates are open!

159
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.253
Oh, Khonshu, for a God,
you are low on faith.

160
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.878
You'll never learn.

161
00:17:55.211 --> 00:17:56.961
Oh, bollocks. Come on. Let's go!

162
00:17:57.045 --> 00:17:59.187
- Come on, let's go.
- You can do it! Almost there!

163
00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:00.503
Yeah.

164
00:18:00.586 --> 00:18:02.420
- I'm slowing us down. Just go.
- Come on!

165
00:18:08.211 --> 00:18:10.003
- Look!
- Coming through!

166
00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:11.961
Osiris, you old softie!

167
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.420
Now, run!

168
00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:17.961
- Hippo!
- Go, go!

169
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.586
Tell me to spare you, and I will.

170
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.545
I choose obliteration over mercy.

171
00:18:23.795 --> 00:18:25.503
We're almost there! Come on!

172
00:18:30.545 --> 00:18:31.545
Marc?

173
00:18:36.128 --> 00:18:37.253
Khonshu...

174
00:18:38.086 --> 00:18:41.420
I feel the pain inside of you.

175
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.920
Do you want death, or do you want life?

176
00:18:45.378 --> 00:18:49.045
Do you swear to protect
the travelers of the night?

177
00:18:50.378 --> 00:18:52.711
Rise and live again!

178
00:19:17.711 --> 00:19:18.711
All right.

179
00:19:20.253 --> 00:19:21.253
Here we go.

180
00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:33.045
Khonshu.

181
00:19:33.503 --> 00:19:34.795
I knew you'd miss me.

182
00:19:34.878 --> 00:19:36.604
Layla turned you down,
didn't she?

183
00:19:36.628 --> 00:19:38.295
A mm it has been freed.

184
00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:40.503
I was not strong enough to stop her.

185
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.128
Marc Spector, I need your help.

186
00:19:43.211 --> 00:19:44.753
Ah, just curious about something.

187
00:19:44.836 --> 00:19:46.756
How's this whole new arrangement
gonna work then?

188
00:19:46.795 --> 00:19:49.503
Steven Grant,
I was not speaking to you.

189
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:52.503
Yeah, all right. But we do come
as like a package deal now,

190
00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:54.295
so you are gonna have to deal with me.

191
00:19:54.378 --> 00:19:57.670
And we did just save your life,
so you're welcome for that.

192
00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:01.711
But I do think that you should answer
my question though.

193
00:20:01.795 --> 00:20:03.461
How's this deal gonna work?

194
00:20:03.545 --> 00:20:07.003
You would negotiate now,
with so much at stake?

195
00:20:07.503 --> 00:20:11.878
Well, we did learn
from the best, you silly old bird.

196
00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:14.628
I will release you both.
You have my word.

197
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:17.628
Mmm. I like the sound of that.

198
00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:20.670
Good. Glad we got that all sorted out.

199
00:20:20.795 --> 00:20:22.711
Now, how the heck
are we gonna get to Cairo?

200
00:20:22.795 --> 00:20:25.170
You forget, little worm,

201
00:20:25.253 --> 00:20:29.128
I am still the God of the Night Sky!

202
00:20:29.253 --> 00:20:32.086
All right, you know what?
I think you can take this one, Marc.

203
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.711
Hurry up, idiots!

204
00:20:45.295 --> 00:20:47.045
Are you the one who released Khonshu?

205
00:20:47.128 --> 00:20:48.128
Yes.

206
00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:56.211
Hey! Hey, hey. Hey. How do we stop A mm it?

207
00:20:58.378 --> 00:21:02.003
This chamber is our most powerful place.

208
00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:08.670
From here, we need to imprison A mm it
in a mortal form.

209
00:21:10.586 --> 00:21:12.211
A body instead of a statue.

210
00:21:12.795 --> 00:21:14.128
She'd be vulnerable.

211
00:21:14.753 --> 00:21:16.753
Okay, how do we do it?

212
00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:22.170
We need more Avatars than we have left...

213
00:21:22.545 --> 00:21:25.086
What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

214
00:21:27.295 --> 00:21:28.920
No, no.

215
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:44.045
Taweret, are you there?

216
00:21:46.795 --> 00:21:48.086
Layla!

217
00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:50.961
I'm so thrilled.
We're gonna have so much fun together.

218
00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:17.086
Oh!

219
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.420
You've changed your mind.

220
00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:21.961
I would be delighted
to accept you as my Avatar.

221
00:22:22.753 --> 00:22:27.295
Okay, okay. Temporary Avatar.

222
00:22:28.295 --> 00:22:29.836
Yes, of course!

223
00:22:30.545 --> 00:22:35.003
Oh, your father is going to be
over the moon when he hears.

224
00:22:39.586 --> 00:22:40.670
My father?

225
00:22:40.795 --> 00:22:44.336
Yes! I met him
when I took him to the Field of Reeds.

226
00:22:46.086 --> 00:22:47.086
What?

227
00:22:47.961 --> 00:22:49.545
Are we doing this or what?

228
00:22:49.878 --> 00:22:53.420
I have a fabulous costume in mind.

229
00:23:38.128 --> 00:23:41.670
Followers of A mm it, judge everyone.

230
00:25:25.795 --> 00:25:28.711
There is so little difference
in what we want for this world.

231
00:25:28.795 --> 00:25:31.086
Why do this dance for the rest of time?

232
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.211
You know the answer.
I only punish those who have chosen evil.

233
00:25:35.378 --> 00:25:39.670
So do I, only I don't give them
the satisfaction of committing it.

234
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:44.461
Be at my side.

235
00:26:03.545 --> 00:26:04.545
Layla?

236
00:26:12.586 --> 00:26:13.586
Layla.

237
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.086
- Marc.
- Oh, baby.

238
00:26:16.295 --> 00:26:18.253
- Thank God you're okay.
- How did you get back?

239
00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:22.211
Wow, you look amazing.
What are you wearing?

240
00:26:27.545 --> 00:26:30.336
Why fight, knowing you will fail?

241
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.961
Because it is my choice!

242
00:26:33.086 --> 00:26:35.420
The very thing you take away.

243
00:26:37.753 --> 00:26:40.711
Hey, I'm really jazzed about
showing you these new skillsets we have.

244
00:26:40.836 --> 00:26:42.253
All right, show me what you got.

245
00:26:42.336 --> 00:26:43.670
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

246
00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:56.461
Come on!

247
00:29:02.461 --> 00:29:04.545
Had A mm it been allowed to rule,

248
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.545
young Randall's life would've been saved,

249
00:29:07.628 --> 00:29:09.961
your family would've been happy.

250
00:29:10.336 --> 00:29:13.878
She need only remove one weed
from the garden.

251
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:15.836
You.

252
00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.711
That wasn't you, was it, Steven?

253
00:30:25.503 --> 00:30:27.045
Not a chance, mate.

254
00:30:33.503 --> 00:30:34.503
Marc?

255
00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:38.711
Yeah.

256
00:30:39.753 --> 00:30:40.961
What the hell was that?

257
00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:44.211
I blacked out.

258
00:30:53.586 --> 00:30:56.045
Get Harrow. I know how to stop A mm it.

259
00:31:05.128 --> 00:31:07.854
The power of this room
will help us bind A mm it to Harrow's body.

260
00:31:07.878 --> 00:31:10.420
Quick, grab my hand
so we can start the spell.

261
00:31:30.878 --> 00:31:33.336
We could've made this our paradise!

262
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.461
It's too late, A mm it.
You will be destroyed.

263
00:32:14.211 --> 00:32:16.628
You can never contain me.

264
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.753
I'll never stop.

265
00:32:25.711 --> 00:32:26.836
Finish it,

266
00:32:27.503 --> 00:32:29.836
and leave neither of them alive.

267
00:32:38.836 --> 00:32:41.920
While he lives, so too does she.

268
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.961
I have to finish this.
If not, I'll never be free.

269
00:32:46.086 --> 00:32:47.086
Marc!

270
00:32:49.045 --> 00:32:52.003
You have a choice. You are free.

271
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.920
The choice is vengeance.

272
00:32:55.003 --> 00:32:58.128
We cannot take the chance
that A mm it finds a way out.

273
00:32:58.211 --> 00:32:59.545
She will kill again.

274
00:33:00.086 --> 00:33:01.545
Now you sound just like her.

275
00:33:05.753 --> 00:33:07.045
You want them dead...

276
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:11.211
Do it yourself.

277
00:33:16.711 --> 00:33:18.003
Now, release us.

278
00:33:26.336 --> 00:33:28.336
As you wish.

279
00:33:44.753 --> 00:33:48.628
So what,
this is what reality looks like?

280
00:33:49.586 --> 00:33:51.711
The imagination is very real.

281
00:33:52.128 --> 00:33:54.670
This chair, desk, the light

282
00:33:55.086 --> 00:33:57.378
were all first created in the imagination.

283
00:33:57.461 --> 00:34:02.586
But do you believe that Khonshu
and A mm it are real?

284
00:34:03.795 --> 00:34:05.961
Do I? No.

285
00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:14.336
And what if we disagree, Doc?

286
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:16.670
Marc...

287
00:34:17.961 --> 00:34:19.795
What if we believe something different?

288
00:34:21.878 --> 00:34:23.711
Then our work here continues.

289
00:34:25.795 --> 00:34:26.795
For how long?

290
00:34:26.878 --> 00:34:28.711
For as long
as a piece of string.

291
00:34:31.503 --> 00:34:33.128
Hey, you see that, don't you?

292
00:34:34.545 --> 00:34:37.295
Oh, yeah, I see it. I see it.

293
00:34:39.628 --> 00:34:40.836
Why am I bleeding?

294
00:34:45.545 --> 00:34:49.878
Yeah, I don't think you know
as much as you think you do.

295
00:34:51.336 --> 00:34:54.420
And while it is tempting
to accept your diagnosis, Doc...

296
00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:58.641
We'd rather go save the world.

297
00:35:00.753 --> 00:35:01.753
Laters, gators.

298
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.961
Steven? You there?

299
00:35:26.253 --> 00:35:27.336
Mmm.

300
00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:30.045
Can't believe it worked.

301
00:35:34.336 --> 00:35:36.586
I can't believe you live
in this fricking mess.

302
00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:45.503
Sand.

303
00:37:47.628 --> 00:37:49.211
Oh, time for bed.

304
00:37:53.211 --> 00:37:54.378
I beg your pardon?

305
00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.295
Khonshu.

306
00:38:49.128 --> 00:38:50.336
You can't hurt us.

307
00:38:52.128 --> 00:38:55.086
Yeah. You wanna know something?

308
00:38:56.753 --> 00:39:01.295
Marc Spector truly believed
that after he and I parted ways,

309
00:39:01.378 --> 00:39:04.253
I wanted his wife to be my Avatar.

310
00:39:04.336 --> 00:39:07.378
Why would I ever need anybody else

311
00:39:08.253 --> 00:39:11.836
when he has no idea
how troubled he truly is?

312
00:39:16.378 --> 00:39:19.170
Meet my friend, Jake Lockley.

313
00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:31.461
Wait.

314
00:39:32.305 --> 00:40:32.466
