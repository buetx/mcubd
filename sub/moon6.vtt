1
00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:12.495
Do you swear to protect
the travelers of the night?

2
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:16.911
We're dead?

3
00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.453
It's the hearts.
They aren't full.

4
00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:24.661
Can you send word to Layla?
Please, help us free Khonshu.

5
00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:29.495
Trust me when I tell you
there's always one last thing.

6
00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:31.138
We could've handled it together.

7
00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:32.703
That's not really what I do, is it?

8
00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:36.995
Do you think that is sense or nonsense?

9
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.245
I'm going to do
what you could not.

10
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.661
Then when it's finished,
and the world is cleansed of abusers,

11
00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:45.953
I want you to remember one thing.

12
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:47.620
Your torment forged me.

13
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.703
I owe my victory to you.

14
00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:54.703
Marc, you've got this.

15
00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:58.536
But if I'm you,
it means I've got this too.

16
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.536
Steven!

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.274
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

18
00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:39.370
I'm sorry it had to be this way,
Marc Spector,

19
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:42.703
Steven Grant,

20
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.495
whoever else might be in there.

21
00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:54.370
Sometimes we need the cold light of death
before we can see reality.

22
00:03:26.703 --> 00:03:28.703
Who wants to heal the world?

23
00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:05.745
Marc. Marc.

24
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.090
It's all right.
It's all right.

25
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.203
It's all right. It's all right.

26
00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:51.536
Show me your papers.

27
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:54.021
I don't need to show you my papers.

28
00:05:54.078 --> 00:05:55.620
You need to show us your soul.

29
00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:23.036
This is the face of a good man.

30
00:06:26.203 --> 00:06:27.495
You don't need this anymore.

31
00:06:29.203 --> 00:06:30.620
Move the bodies out of the way.

32
00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:34.286
Let's go! Clear a path.

33
00:06:57.036 --> 00:06:58.476
Don't do it.

34
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.286
Layla, wait. I am the Goddess Taweret.

35
00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:09.536
Layla,

36
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:12.120
it's Marc who's telling you to stop.

37
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:13.411
What the hell is this?

38
00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:16.536
He's dead.

39
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.286
And I'm talking to you through dead people
right now. So what?

40
00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:22.911
Listen, Harrow is too powerful for you
to stop him alone.

41
00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:23.995
If Marc...

42
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:26.411
If he can return to life...

43
00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:29.161
What do you mean, "return to life"?

44
00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:36.786
He is going to need Khonshu.

45
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.120
Break his ushabti.

46
00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:40.911
It's in the Chamber of the Gods.

47
00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.370
And you can be my Avatar.

48
00:07:44.078 --> 00:07:45.786
Marc says wonderful things about you.

49
00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:47.911
No, no, no. I'll fight him on my own.

50
00:07:47.995 --> 00:07:48.995
It's time to go!

51
00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:26.161
The disturbance.

52
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.745
Your Gods felt it too.

53
00:08:27.828 --> 00:08:28.828
But what does it mean?

54
00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:31.786
Someone is trying to release A mm it.

55
00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:34.328
But why?

56
00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:36.620
Harrow.

57
00:08:38.786 --> 00:08:43.078
Come. You won't believe
what the Gods have hidden from mankind.

58
00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:54.453
You're judges, not warriors.

59
00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:57.036
This doesn't need to happen.

60
00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:16.453
This was all so avoidable.

61
00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:04.578
To whom do I owe my gratitude?

62
00:10:04.786 --> 00:10:07.203
Your humble disciple, my Goddess,

63
00:10:07.828 --> 00:10:09.578
to whom you owe nothing.

64
00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.036
Your Scales lack balance.

65
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.495
I understand.

66
00:10:16.203 --> 00:10:21.453
I had hoped my penance
might correct my imbalance,

67
00:10:21.578 --> 00:10:23.370
but I see now that's impossible.

68
00:10:24.203 --> 00:10:27.411
I accept the Scales
regardless of the outcome.

69
00:10:27.703 --> 00:10:30.620
They lack balance
because of what lies ahead of you.

70
00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:34.036
Then we must spare the world
the pain I will cause.

71
00:10:36.078 --> 00:10:37.411
I willingly submit.

72
00:10:37.495 --> 00:10:40.453
What lies ahead of you
is your service to me.

73
00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:43.328
How may I serve you in death?

74
00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:45.203
Your death is delayed.

75
00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:49.995
I once relied on a servant
whose Scales balanced perfectly.

76
00:10:50.411 --> 00:10:54.745
In exchange,
I was bound to stone for 2,000 years.

77
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.036
But I have disciples
all over the world

78
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.495
whose Scales balance perfectly,
awaiting your command.

79
00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.370
They are worthy, my Goddess.

80
00:11:04.453 --> 00:11:06.703
But you are the one who set me free.

81
00:11:06.786 --> 00:11:09.245
You are the Avatar that I need.

82
00:11:09.786 --> 00:11:12.995
Serve me, and you will find peace.

83
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.536
Do not let the pain
of the past control you.

84
00:11:24.286 --> 00:11:25.370
As you wish.

85
00:11:35.745 --> 00:11:39.453
I do not sense
Marc Spector in this world.

86
00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:42.953
He died fighting, no doubt.

87
00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.328
Fighting your war.

88
00:11:45.411 --> 00:11:47.078
And it's far from over.

89
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:50.911
If Marc is truly gone,
I am in need of an Avatar.

90
00:11:50.995 --> 00:11:54.870
Would you, Layla El-Faouly,
protect the travelers of the night...

91
00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:56.245
Are you joking?

92
00:11:57.245 --> 00:12:00.786
You turned Marc's life
into a waking nightmare.

93
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:03.370
Why would I ever sign up for that?

94
00:12:03.578 --> 00:12:07.536
Because you won't win
against Harrow and A mm it alone.

95
00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:09.370
I'll take my chances.

96
00:12:09.453 --> 00:12:11.870
Marc was in crisis over you.

97
00:12:11.953 --> 00:12:14.620
His lack of focus got him killed.

98
00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:18.328
You need a plan, little bug.
What I offer...

99
00:12:18.411 --> 00:12:21.203
I don't care what you can offer.

100
00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:24.995
Marc didn't trust you.

101
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.661
I don't trust you.

102
00:12:31.203 --> 00:12:35.703
We'll work together
without me enslaving myself.

103
00:12:36.495 --> 00:12:39.203
We must rebind A mm it.

104
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:40.661
How?

105
00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:43.328
Only an Avatar can do it.

106
00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:46.036
I said "no."

107
00:12:48.495 --> 00:12:53.036
Let us purify the souls of Cairo
and then the world.

108
00:13:03.495 --> 00:13:06.578
Khonshu. Time has been cruel to you.

109
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.995
Indeed.
I cannot allow you to proceed.

110
00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:12.911
There's someone else here.
Find who released him.

111
00:13:21.453 --> 00:13:22.786
The Scales are balanced.

112
00:13:23.786 --> 00:13:25.161
Your heart is full.

113
00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:30.203
Your journey is over.

114
00:13:34.786 --> 00:13:37.536
It's so...

115
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.703
quiet.

116
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.078
The peace you've always wanted
but never had.

117
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.286
You're manifesting it.

118
00:13:44.745 --> 00:13:48.828
No danger. No loneliness or hurt.

119
00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:50.786
What about Steven?

120
00:13:51.536 --> 00:13:54.411
He's gone, Marc. The Duat has him.

121
00:13:55.203 --> 00:13:57.411
Please enjoy your peace.

122
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:09.828
We need to go back for him.

123
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:14.370
It doesn't work like that.

124
00:14:14.828 --> 00:14:17.078
Leave here, and you can't return.

125
00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:21.620
Anyway, you don't need him anymore, Marc.

126
00:14:21.786 --> 00:14:24.328
So I get to go on to eternal peace,
and he just...

127
00:14:25.161 --> 00:14:26.911
stays lost in the sand forever?

128
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:32.828
No, I'm not good with that.

129
00:14:33.953 --> 00:14:36.036
Wait! Think about this!

130
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.120
My path is set, same as anyone's.

131
00:15:00.245 --> 00:15:02.161
I'm here to bring balance.

132
00:15:02.411 --> 00:15:05.578
You speak of balance,
yet you choose him.

133
00:15:05.703 --> 00:15:07.120
Your Avatar is a sinner!

134
00:15:07.203 --> 00:15:08.786
You're jealous of his loyalty.

135
00:15:08.911 --> 00:15:10.245
Loyalty at what cost?

136
00:15:10.328 --> 00:15:13.328
An empty world
for your disciples to inherit?

137
00:15:13.411 --> 00:15:16.786
Don't listen to him.
He only wants to keep you bound.

138
00:15:31.536 --> 00:15:33.161
Steven.

139
00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:37.536
Looking pretty rough, man.

140
00:15:40.536 --> 00:15:41.816
I don't know if you can hear me.

141
00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:45.161
From the moment you arrived,

142
00:15:46.411 --> 00:15:48.911
way back then, we were so young.

143
00:15:50.495 --> 00:15:51.495
You saved me.

144
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.536
I survived because I knew I wasn't alone.

145
00:15:58.078 --> 00:16:01.578
You were always there,
alive, full of hope.

146
00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:05.286
And I tried to protect that, and I failed.
I couldn't protect you.

147
00:16:12.453 --> 00:16:15.786
- But you didn't abandon me.
- You didn't abandon me.

148
00:16:16.453 --> 00:16:19.036
And although that field back there
was looking...

149
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.745
It was looking pretty good...

150
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.536
There's no way in hell
I'm gonna abandon you.

151
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.911
You are the only real superpower...

152
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.953
I ever had.

153
00:17:10.703 --> 00:17:11.703
Marc.

154
00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:15.161
Steven.

155
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.245
You came back?
What the hell's wrong with you?

156
00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:26.411
Well, I did a whole little speech there.

157
00:17:26.536 --> 00:17:27.736
It wasn't that little.

158
00:17:29.828 --> 00:17:31.995
Marc, look. The Gates are open!

159
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.453
Oh, Khonshu, for a God,
you are low on faith.

160
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.078
You'll never learn.

161
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.161
Oh, bollocks. Come on. Let's go!

162
00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:02.387
- Come on, let's go.
- You can do it! Almost there!

163
00:18:02.411 --> 00:18:03.703
Yeah.

164
00:18:03.786 --> 00:18:05.620
- I'm slowing us down. Just go.
- Come on!

165
00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:13.203
- Look!
- Coming through!

166
00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:15.161
Osiris, you old softie!

167
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.620
Now, run!

168
00:18:18.828 --> 00:18:21.161
- Hippo!
- Go, go!

169
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.786
Tell me to spare you, and I will.

170
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.745
I choose obliteration over mercy.

171
00:18:26.995 --> 00:18:28.703
We're almost there! Come on!

172
00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:34.745
Marc?

173
00:18:39.328 --> 00:18:40.453
Khonshu...

174
00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:44.620
I feel the pain inside of you.

175
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.120
Do you want death, or do you want life?

176
00:18:48.578 --> 00:18:52.245
Do you swear to protect
the travelers of the night?

177
00:18:53.578 --> 00:18:55.911
Rise and live again!

178
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:21.911
All right.

179
00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:24.453
Here we go.

180
00:19:35.245 --> 00:19:36.245
Khonshu.

181
00:19:36.703 --> 00:19:37.995
I knew you'd miss me.

182
00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:39.804
Layla turned you down,
didn't she?

183
00:19:39.828 --> 00:19:41.495
A mm it has been freed.

184
00:19:41.578 --> 00:19:43.703
I was not strong enough to stop her.

185
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.328
Marc Spector, I need your help.

186
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:47.953
Ah, just curious about something.

187
00:19:48.036 --> 00:19:49.956
How's this whole new arrangement
gonna work then?

188
00:19:49.995 --> 00:19:52.703
Steven Grant,
I was not speaking to you.

189
00:19:52.911 --> 00:19:55.703
Yeah, all right. But we do come
as like a package deal now,

190
00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:57.495
so you are gonna have to deal with me.

191
00:19:57.578 --> 00:20:00.870
And we did just save your life,
so you're welcome for that.

192
00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:04.911
But I do think that you should answer
my question though.

193
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:06.661
How's this deal gonna work?

194
00:20:06.745 --> 00:20:10.203
You would negotiate now,
with so much at stake?

195
00:20:10.703 --> 00:20:15.078
Well, we did learn
from the best, you silly old bird.

196
00:20:15.161 --> 00:20:17.828
I will release you both.
You have my word.

197
00:20:18.411 --> 00:20:20.828
Mmm. I like the sound of that.

198
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:23.870
Good. Glad we got that all sorted out.

199
00:20:23.995 --> 00:20:25.911
Now, how the heck
are we gonna get to Cairo?

200
00:20:25.995 --> 00:20:28.370
You forget, little worm,

201
00:20:28.453 --> 00:20:32.328
I am still the God of the Night Sky!

202
00:20:32.453 --> 00:20:35.286
All right, you know what?
I think you can take this one, Marc.

203
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.911
Hurry up, idiots!

204
00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:50.245
Are you the one who released Khonshu?

205
00:20:50.328 --> 00:20:51.328
Yes.

206
00:20:56.286 --> 00:20:59.411
Hey! Hey, hey. Hey. How do we stop A mm it?

207
00:21:01.578 --> 00:21:05.203
This chamber is our most powerful place.

208
00:21:06.495 --> 00:21:11.870
From here, we need to imprison A mm it
in a mortal form.

209
00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:15.411
A body instead of a statue.

210
00:21:15.995 --> 00:21:17.328
She'd be vulnerable.

211
00:21:17.953 --> 00:21:19.953
Okay, how do we do it?

212
00:21:21.245 --> 00:21:25.370
We need more Avatars than we have left...

213
00:21:25.745 --> 00:21:28.286
What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

214
00:21:30.495 --> 00:21:32.120
No, no.

215
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.245
Taweret, are you there?

216
00:21:49.995 --> 00:21:51.286
Layla!

217
00:21:51.536 --> 00:21:54.161
I'm so thrilled.
We're gonna have so much fun together.

218
00:22:19.161 --> 00:22:20.286
Oh!

219
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.620
You've changed your mind.

220
00:22:21.703 --> 00:22:25.161
I would be delighted
to accept you as my Avatar.

221
00:22:25.953 --> 00:22:30.495
Okay, okay. Temporary Avatar.

222
00:22:31.495 --> 00:22:33.036
Yes, of course!

223
00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:38.203
Oh, your father is going to be
over the moon when he hears.

224
00:22:42.786 --> 00:22:43.870
My father?

225
00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:47.536
Yes! I met him
when I took him to the Field of Reeds.

226
00:22:49.286 --> 00:22:50.286
What?

227
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.745
Are we doing this or what?

228
00:22:53.078 --> 00:22:56.620
I have a fabulous costume in mind.

229
00:23:41.328 --> 00:23:44.870
Followers of A mm it, judge everyone.

230
00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:31.911
There is so little difference
in what we want for this world.

231
00:25:31.995 --> 00:25:34.286
Why do this dance for the rest of time?

232
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.411
You know the answer.
I only punish those who have chosen evil.

233
00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:42.870
So do I, only I don't give them
the satisfaction of committing it.

234
00:25:45.161 --> 00:25:47.661
Be at my side.

235
00:26:06.745 --> 00:26:07.745
Layla?

236
00:26:15.786 --> 00:26:16.786
Layla.

237
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.286
- Marc.
- Oh, baby.

238
00:26:19.495 --> 00:26:21.453
- Thank God you're okay.
- How did you get back?

239
00:26:22.578 --> 00:26:25.411
Wow, you look amazing.
What are you wearing?

240
00:26:30.745 --> 00:26:33.536
Why fight, knowing you will fail?

241
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.161
Because it is my choice!

242
00:26:36.286 --> 00:26:38.620
The very thing you take away.

243
00:26:40.953 --> 00:26:43.911
Hey, I'm really jazzed about
showing you these new skillsets we have.

244
00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:45.453
All right, show me what you got.

245
00:26:45.536 --> 00:26:46.870
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

246
00:28:58.661 --> 00:28:59.661
Come on!

247
00:29:05.661 --> 00:29:07.745
Had A mm it been allowed to rule,

248
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.745
young Randall's life would've been saved,

249
00:29:10.828 --> 00:29:13.161
your family would've been happy.

250
00:29:13.536 --> 00:29:17.078
She need only remove one weed
from the garden.

251
00:29:18.036 --> 00:29:19.036
You.

252
00:30:24.286 --> 00:30:25.911
That wasn't you, was it, Steven?

253
00:30:28.703 --> 00:30:30.245
Not a chance, mate.

254
00:30:36.703 --> 00:30:37.703
Marc?

255
00:30:40.911 --> 00:30:41.911
Yeah.

256
00:30:42.953 --> 00:30:44.161
What the hell was that?

257
00:30:46.161 --> 00:30:47.411
I blacked out.

258
00:30:56.786 --> 00:30:59.245
Get Harrow. I know how to stop A mm it.

259
00:31:08.328 --> 00:31:11.054
The power of this room
will help us bind A mm it to Harrow's body.

260
00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:13.620
Quick, grab my hand
so we can start the spell.

261
00:31:34.078 --> 00:31:36.536
We could've made this our paradise!

262
00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.661
It's too late, A mm it.
You will be destroyed.

263
00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:19.828
You can never contain me.

264
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.953
I'll never stop.

265
00:32:28.911 --> 00:32:30.036
Finish it,

266
00:32:30.703 --> 00:32:33.036
and leave neither of them alive.

267
00:32:42.036 --> 00:32:45.120
While he lives, so too does she.

268
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.161
I have to finish this.
If not, I'll never be free.

269
00:32:49.286 --> 00:32:50.286
Marc!

270
00:32:52.245 --> 00:32:55.203
You have a choice. You are free.

271
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.120
The choice is vengeance.

272
00:32:58.203 --> 00:33:01.328
We cannot take the chance
that A mm it finds a way out.

273
00:33:01.411 --> 00:33:02.745
She will kill again.

274
00:33:03.286 --> 00:33:04.745
Now you sound just like her.

275
00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:10.245
You want them dead...

276
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.411
Do it yourself.

277
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:21.203
Now, release us.

278
00:33:29.536 --> 00:33:31.536
As you wish.

279
00:33:47.953 --> 00:33:51.828
So what,
this is what reality looks like?

280
00:33:52.786 --> 00:33:54.911
The imagination is very real.

281
00:33:55.328 --> 00:33:57.870
This chair, desk, the light

282
00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:00.578
were all first created in the imagination.

283
00:34:00.661 --> 00:34:05.786
But do you believe that Khonshu
and A mm it are real?

284
00:34:06.995 --> 00:34:09.161
Do I? No.

285
00:34:15.911 --> 00:34:17.536
And what if we disagree, Doc?

286
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.870
Marc...

287
00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:22.995
What if we believe something different?

288
00:34:25.078 --> 00:34:26.911
Then our work here continues.

289
00:34:28.995 --> 00:34:29.995
For how long?

290
00:34:30.078 --> 00:34:31.911
For as long
as a piece of string.

291
00:34:34.703 --> 00:34:36.328
Hey, you see that, don't you?

292
00:34:37.745 --> 00:34:40.495
Oh, yeah, I see it. I see it.

293
00:34:42.828 --> 00:34:44.036
Why am I bleeding?

294
00:34:48.745 --> 00:34:53.078
Yeah, I don't think you know
as much as you think you do.

295
00:34:54.536 --> 00:34:57.620
And while it is tempting
to accept your diagnosis, Doc...

296
00:35:00.161 --> 00:35:01.841
We'd rather go save the world.

297
00:35:03.953 --> 00:35:04.953
Laters, gators.

298
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.161
Steven? You there?

299
00:35:29.453 --> 00:35:30.536
Mmm.

300
00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:33.245
Can't believe it worked.

301
00:35:37.536 --> 00:35:39.786
I can't believe you live
in this fricking mess.

302
00:37:47.495 --> 00:37:48.703
Sand.

303
00:37:50.828 --> 00:37:52.411
Oh, time for bed.

304
00:37:56.411 --> 00:37:57.578
I beg your pardon?

305
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:50.495
Khonshu.

306
00:38:52.328 --> 00:38:53.536
You can't hurt us.

307
00:38:55.328 --> 00:38:58.286
Yeah. You wanna know something?

308
00:38:59.953 --> 00:39:04.495
Marc Spector truly believed
that after he and I parted ways,

309
00:39:04.578 --> 00:39:07.453
I wanted his wife to be my Avatar.

310
00:39:07.536 --> 00:39:10.578
Why would I ever need anybody else

311
00:39:11.453 --> 00:39:15.036
when he has no idea
how troubled he truly is?

312
00:39:19.578 --> 00:39:22.370
Meet my friend, Jake Lockley.

313
00:39:33.661 --> 00:39:34.661
Wait.

314
00:39:35.505 --> 00:40:35.666
