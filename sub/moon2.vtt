00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.967
- It's maddening, isn't it?
- Hello?

2
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:14.658
The voice in your head.

3
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:18.616
Relentless, forever unsatisfied.

4
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.283
What's this?

5
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:23.283
Layla.

6
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.075
- Oh, my God, you're alive.
- Yeah, all right.

7
00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:29.408
That's it? I've been texting
and calling you for months.

8
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.283
My body wants to get up
and wander about, you know?

9
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.241
And I don't even know about it
until I wake up wherever.

10
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.991
Strange, innit?

11
00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:42.658
I strongly encourage you to return that.

12
00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:43.991
Here, take it.

13
00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:46.116
That was so strange. Sorry about...

14
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:47.575
I will not ask again.

15
00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:50.116
Oh, my God!

16
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:53.033
You're not gonna die.

17
00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:56.241
Let me save us.

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.274
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

19
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.908
No, no, no.

20
00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:16.325
You there?

21
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:17.825
Hmm?

22
00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:20.575
No?

23
00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.741
Yeah, didn't think so.

24
00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:54.783
Bruv, hey.

25
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.741
Oh, hey. Bro, it is proper mad in here.

26
00:02:57.825 --> 00:02:59.200
What happened? What is it?

27
00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:03.158
They're saying burst pipes,
but don't look like that to me.

28
00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:06.325
Has anyone seen the security footage?

29
00:03:07.075 --> 00:03:08.783
Well, yeah, I was about to.

30
00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:12.658
All right. I think
I should go with you, yeah?

31
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:16.158
I may have some information about it.

32
00:03:17.783 --> 00:03:19.158
- All right, come on.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:22.575
Do not tell Donna
that I let you into this arena.

34
00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:25.616
Bruv, listen, I must warn you.

35
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.658
What you're about to see
is gonna melt your brain. Yeah?

36
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.241
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

37
00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:36.033
It's like Area 51,
like MI6 bonkers, bruv. Yeah?

38
00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.283
- All right. All right, mate.
- You ready?

39
00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:39.408
Yeah.

40
00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:41.200
Roll the tape.

41
00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:46.616
Is that you, Scotty?

42
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:50.741
Still Steven.
And yeah, that's me. Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.658
Watch, here it comes.

44
00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:55.366
Are you cryin'?

45
00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:59.741
A bit. Yeah, a bit.
Watch, here it comes. Wait for it.

46
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.450
Wait for it.

47
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.825
How long am I waitin'?

48
00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:07.406
Different angle, yeah?
Different, different.

49
00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:10.575
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Wait for it, here it comes.

50
00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.075
No, no, no, wait.

51
00:04:13.158 --> 00:04:15.950
Why are you going in...
What are you doing, you donut?

52
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.908
No, just a minute. Here it comes.

53
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.690
Wait, wait. Now, just a minute.

54
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.991
- You messed up the loos.
- Shh. I don't...

55
00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:24.366
- Mate!
- Oh, God.

56
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.200
Larry in Maintenance
is gonna absolutely shoot you.

57
00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:31.116
I swear to God, there was
a dog chasing me, like a big hound, or...

58
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.575
Hound of the Baskervilles, was it?

59
00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:35.450
- Egyptian jackal. It was a jackal.
- I've heard it all now.

60
00:04:37.658 --> 00:04:40.491
Oh, God. Oh, God.

61
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:44.366
Fast forward till when I come out.
When I come out.

62
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.950
Oh, yeah, why not, yeah.

63
00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:47.491
Let me do it.

64
00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:49.950
- Now, there. Have a look.
- Yeah, yeah...

65
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.825
It's still you, bruv.

66
00:05:00.283 --> 00:05:01.408
That's not me.

67
00:05:11.575 --> 00:05:15.241
I should tell you, the museum
has no wish to press charges.

68
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.825
- Okay.
- But Mr. Grant,

69
00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:20.783
we've spoken to your colleagues.

70
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.491
Yeah?

71
00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:26.158
It's all been a bit of a struggle
for you recently, hey?

72
00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:30.200
Yeah. A bit, a bit.

73
00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:34.991
This particular group of doctors
has a long-standing relationship with us.

74
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.700
Doctors?

75
00:05:38.408 --> 00:05:39.408
Oh.

76
00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:44.366
They're wonderful.

77
00:05:45.283 --> 00:05:47.241
- Yeah?
- I could arrange an appointment.

78
00:05:48.116 --> 00:05:49.991
Okay. Yeah.

79
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.241
It looks...
It actually looks quite posh.

80
00:05:54.116 --> 00:05:56.616
Looks like they're
very good listeners, right?

81
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:57.825
They really are.

82
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.991
I know this is classic HR to say, but...

83
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.783
But you're not alone.

84
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.116
Yeah. That's, like,
part of the problem, innit?

85
00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:14.283
Before you leave us,
I'm sorry for the protocol of it, but...

86
00:06:14.491 --> 00:06:16.575
Any museum property on your person?

87
00:06:16.658 --> 00:06:20.116
No, I haven't nicked anything.
I swear. I...

88
00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:27.325
No, nothing.

89
00:06:28.616 --> 00:06:29.616
Uh...

90
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:36.116
Yeah.

91
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.908
Well, that's it. I got the sack.

92
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:53.950
I don't blame 'em. I'm a vandal.
I should've been arrested.

93
00:06:57.991 --> 00:07:01.658
I did find things hidden in my flat.

94
00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:04.075
I swear. I'm not joking.

95
00:07:06.366 --> 00:07:08.033
That's worth exploring, isn't it?

96
00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:10.616
Like, if I could find that storage locker,

97
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.200
that might be my one chance
to prove to myself that I'm not mad.

98
00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:19.866
Oh, mate, thank you. Thanks. Cheers.

99
00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:30.616
- Hiya.
- Hey.

100
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.866
- You all right?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.991
Yeah. Um, look, man, this is, like,
the fifth branch I've been to.

102
00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:38.950
I'm looking for my storage locker.
It's under "Steven Grant."

103
00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:42.158
If it's not under Steven Grant,
it might be under "Marc."

104
00:07:42.241 --> 00:07:45.450
I don't have a surname, just Marc.

105
00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:48.200
Would you have a look for me,
if that's all right?

106
00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:52.658
- I know it sounds...
- Of course. I know you. #43, right?

107
00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:54.741
I never forget a face.

108
00:07:58.866 --> 00:07:59.866
All right.

109
00:09:20.866 --> 00:09:21.950
Oh, my God.

110
00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:47.450
"Marc Spector."

111
00:09:56.408 --> 00:09:57.616
No way.

112
00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:02.741
It's real. It's totally real.

113
00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:10.825
Whoa.

114
00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:19.825
I'd say you are a compass,
but you're not pointing north.

115
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:24.991
Steven, I need you
to listen to me very carefully.

116
00:10:25.075 --> 00:10:26.075
Marc?

117
00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:28.908
There he is. Here he comes.

118
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:33.033
Hello, man in the mirror.
I was wondering if you'd pop up again.

119
00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:34.991
- I know you're scared.
- A bit, yeah.

120
00:10:35.075 --> 00:10:37.592
I know you're confused.
You weren't supposed to see any of this.

121
00:10:37.616 --> 00:10:39.408
No? Well, bit late for that, innit?

122
00:10:39.491 --> 00:10:43.700
So, what? Am I, like, meant to be some
sort of mad secret agent or something?

123
00:10:43.783 --> 00:10:45.491
It's a little more complicated than that.

124
00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:47.908
More complicated? What? Am I possessed?

125
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:51.991
- Are you, like, a demon? Or...
- You're in danger, and I can save us,

126
00:10:52.658 --> 00:10:54.033
just like I did last night.

127
00:10:54.116 --> 00:10:57.575
But I can't have you interfering
in what I have left to do.

128
00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.283
So, this is what's gonna happen.

129
00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:02.783
You're gonna go lay down
on that cot back there.

130
00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:05.991
- You're gonna take a nice nap.
- Are you joking?

131
00:11:06.075 --> 00:11:08.950
Sleep... I'm never gonna
go to sleep again. You hear me?

132
00:11:10.033 --> 00:11:13.325
Look, I don't care
how bloody handsome you are.

133
00:11:13.408 --> 00:11:17.200
Tell me what it is you are. What are you?

134
00:11:17.908 --> 00:11:20.325
- You sure you want to know?
- Yes, bloody... Yes.

135
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.408
I serve Khonshu. I'm his Avatar.

136
00:11:25.158 --> 00:11:27.950
Which means you are, too. Sort of.

137
00:11:29.408 --> 00:11:32.033
We protect the vulnerable

138
00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:35.700
and deliver Khonshu's justice
to those who hurt them.

139
00:11:35.783 --> 00:11:37.283
- Khonshu?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:37.366 --> 00:11:39.366
The Egyptian god of the moon?

141
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:44.200
Oh, my God, that's
the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

142
00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:47.283
I eat one piece of steak, and then, bam,
I go bonkers.

143
00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:51.283
Oh, God. I'm having a panic attack.

144
00:11:52.575 --> 00:11:55.033
- I made a deal with Khonshu.
- I need to go to hospital.

145
00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:58.283
That deal is contingent
on you not interfering, Steven.

146
00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:03.033
Now, give me the body. Let me finish this,
and you'll never hear from me again.

147
00:12:03.116 --> 00:12:06.033
You want my body? Right, yeah.

148
00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:10.950
Marc, how about this for a deal? I'm gonna
take this bag full of illegal shit, yeah?

149
00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:13.283
And I'm gonna go
straight to the authorities.

150
00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:16.408
And they're gonna put me away
so I don't hurt anyone else.

151
00:12:16.491 --> 00:12:20.366
And hopefully, NHS will
fill me with enough pills

152
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.325
so that you get out of my head!

153
00:12:40.783 --> 00:12:42.575
Oh, God. Oh, God.

154
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.741
Give it back, you fool.

155
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.366
Marc? Where have you been?

156
00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:39.200
Layla?

157
00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:43.491
What the hell is going on? Is this
Steven the latest fake identity for you?

158
00:13:43.575 --> 00:13:46.908
I figured you were using a coded message
when we spoke on the phone.

159
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:48.075
How did you find me?

160
00:13:48.158 --> 00:13:50.033
How'd you think?
I tracked your phone.

161
00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:52.825
I thought you wanted me
to do that when you turned it on.

162
00:13:52.908 --> 00:13:54.200
Right. Yeah.

163
00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:58.241
You know, you really could have
given me any sign that you were alive.

164
00:13:58.325 --> 00:14:01.033
I thought that you were in danger,
or kidnapped again.

165
00:14:01.116 --> 00:14:03.325
I just kept thinking,
"He's got the suit. He's fine."

166
00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:06.700
Then, I thought, "Well, what if he gets
ambushed when he's not wearing it?"

167
00:14:06.783 --> 00:14:08.491
And "What if he doesn't have it?" And...

168
00:14:08.575 --> 00:14:11.533
- Stop clasping my shoulder like that.
- I don't know where to hold.

169
00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:13.533
Feels like riding
with a Victorian duchess.

170
00:14:13.616 --> 00:14:14.700
Where do I hang on?

171
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.283
Do you see the spiral you put me through?

172
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:28.075
It's not okay, yeah? I'm still your wife.

173
00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:33.658
By the way, this would be a great time
for you to say something. Anything.

174
00:14:33.741 --> 00:14:36.741
- Just in case it's not clear.
- Sorry, sorry... Did you say wife?

175
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.325
My... Are we married?

176
00:14:39.408 --> 00:14:41.950
Look, I'm pretty sure
we lost whoever was chasing you.

177
00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:44.366
- Just drop the act.
- It's not an act. I...

178
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.908
- Stop with the accent, please.
- This is how I talk.

179
00:14:48.283 --> 00:14:51.825
- Okay. Get off the bike.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Please.

180
00:14:51.908 --> 00:14:55.325
Please, I will tell you everything,
just get me to my flat, yeah?

181
00:14:56.658 --> 00:14:57.741
Just get me home.

182
00:15:07.116 --> 00:15:08.116
All right.

183
00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:25.866
She shouldn't be here.

184
00:15:27.116 --> 00:15:30.116
Get her out of here, Steven.
You're way out of your depth.

185
00:15:32.283 --> 00:15:33.533
I just want my life back.

186
00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:36.241
Yeah, I'm getting that.

187
00:15:36.325 --> 00:15:41.075
No. Sorry, I wasn't talking to you,
just talking to myself. Sort of.

188
00:15:41.158 --> 00:15:45.491
- Uh, this is your flat, Marc?
- Um, I'm Steven.

189
00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:48.158
Are you living here with someone else?

190
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.075
No, no, no.

191
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.616
No, this is my mum's flat.

192
00:15:53.825 --> 00:15:56.783
Okay, so you guys are talking again?

193
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.700
Mmm-hmm.

194
00:16:04.283 --> 00:16:06.033
Marceline Desbordes-Valmore?

195
00:16:07.283 --> 00:16:08.366
Yep.

196
00:16:21.283 --> 00:16:22.325
Oui, oui.

197
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:25.491
She's my favorite poet.

198
00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:29.283
Um, no, she's my favorite.

199
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.408
That's mental.

200
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:38.366
So, you're learning
French and hieroglyphics?

201
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.408
Yeah, well...
That's not that impressive, really.

202
00:16:42.866 --> 00:16:45.075
It's not like hieroglyphs
are a whole language.

203
00:16:45.158 --> 00:16:46.866
- It's more like a...
- Like an alphabet.

204
00:16:49.116 --> 00:16:51.241
Yeah, and... Well, you still have to know

205
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.075
- ancient Egyptian to read it.
- Sure.

206
00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:57.991
- For example, like this one here, right?
- Funeral rites.

207
00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:04.033
Well, someone knows
their unilaterals. You.

208
00:17:05.283 --> 00:17:07.700
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

209
00:17:09.075 --> 00:17:14.033
- Sorry, I don't mean that in a creepy way.
- No, I'm sorry. I'm not buying this, Marc.

210
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.116
Use whatever accent you want. Yeah.

211
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.450
Let's just get this over with. You sent
these papers but you never signed them.

212
00:17:21.325 --> 00:17:22.616
Did I? Uh...

213
00:17:22.783 --> 00:17:25.658
This is what you wanted.

214
00:17:25.741 --> 00:17:27.283
Have a look here.

215
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:31.575
After everything, you told me
that we needed to move on.

216
00:17:32.283 --> 00:17:35.783
All right. Divo... Divorce?

217
00:17:37.075 --> 00:17:38.700
Yeah, we doing this or not?

218
00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:41.575
I would never divorce you.

219
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.491
What are you doing?

220
00:17:49.116 --> 00:17:52.866
Look, you seem absolutely lovely.

221
00:17:53.241 --> 00:17:58.325
This Marc, on the other hand,
is a right twit. Yeah?

222
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.908
I don't know how to explain
what's been happening.

223
00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:05.075
- Steven.
- I don't expect you to believe me.

224
00:18:05.158 --> 00:18:08.241
- Steven, listen to me.
- I honestly don't really believe myself.

225
00:18:08.325 --> 00:18:10.991
- All I can do is try to...
- You're making a mistake.

226
00:18:11.075 --> 00:18:12.991
- ...try to show you what I found.
- Steve...

227
00:18:13.075 --> 00:18:16.616
- I found this bag in the storage locker.
- Steven, don't... Listen to me.

228
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.991
- Inside of it is all sorts...
- Stop what you're doing right now.

229
00:18:20.075 --> 00:18:22.200
- ...of things.
- Don't show her what's in the bag.

230
00:18:22.283 --> 00:18:25.533
- Most interestingly...
- You're gonna get her killed. You hear me?

231
00:18:27.158 --> 00:18:29.575
Most interestingly is what?

232
00:18:29.658 --> 00:18:32.866
You show her that scarab, you're
responsible when they come after her.

233
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.908
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

234
00:18:35.158 --> 00:18:36.408
Nothing. Never mind.

235
00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:38.658
- What's in there?
- Nothing... Wait, wait...

236
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:41.075
Bloody hell.

237
00:18:44.408 --> 00:18:48.991
The scarab pointing to Ammit's ushabti?
What we fought side by side for.

238
00:18:49.533 --> 00:18:51.866
- No...
- This whole one-man show is just what?

239
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.950
So that you can keep it for yourself?

240
00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:56.075
- No. I swear...
- After all we've been...

241
00:18:56.158 --> 00:19:00.241
Just stop! I'm supposed to believe
anything you say with this shoved in

242
00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:03.116
- what, a gym bag?
- Take it. Take it, you can have it.

243
00:19:03.866 --> 00:19:08.241
Take it. I don't want it. I don't want it.
I swear. Have it.

244
00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:13.075
I am not Marc Spector.

245
00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:18.658
I'm Steven Grant. I work in a gift shop.
Well, I used to work in a gift shop.

246
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:22.450
And I think I'm in real danger,

247
00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:26.033
and I think maybe that you might be
the only person that can help me.

248
00:19:28.366 --> 00:19:29.533
Please.

249
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:34.283
You really don't remember
why we've been looking for this?

250
00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:37.241
Our adventures.

251
00:19:39.116 --> 00:19:41.158
Or our life together?

252
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:44.366
Oh, God, I wish I could.

253
00:19:46.575 --> 00:19:48.866
Steven Grant, can we have a word?

254
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.658
See? Oh, God, they've come for me.

255
00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:54.866
- Why?
- I vandalized the toilet.

256
00:19:57.158 --> 00:19:58.658
Yeah, just a minute.

257
00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:01.741
Steven Grant?

258
00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:04.325
- Yeah?
- DC Fitzgerald and DC Kennedy here.

259
00:20:04.408 --> 00:20:05.866
Yeah, one second.

260
00:20:09.116 --> 00:20:11.241
Hello, officers.

261
00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:12.783
Steven Grant?

262
00:20:14.283 --> 00:20:17.575
I think so, yeah. I mean, yep, yes.

263
00:20:17.658 --> 00:20:19.658
That's me, 100% Steven Grant.

264
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.158
Sorry, I was just havin' a bit of a day.

265
00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:27.634
Mind if we come in, Mr. Grant?

266
00:20:27.658 --> 00:20:30.991
- Oh, um, actually, right now isn't...
- Appreciate it.

267
00:20:31.658 --> 00:20:33.450
Anyone else here with you?

268
00:20:33.575 --> 00:20:37.325
Uh, here with me? No, just me and my fish.

269
00:20:37.408 --> 00:20:38.491
Yeah.

270
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.991
So, um...

271
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.825
Yeah.

272
00:20:46.575 --> 00:20:48.033
Is this about the toilet?

273
00:20:48.533 --> 00:20:52.450
'Cause it's been dealt with.
Yeah. I've been sacked.

274
00:20:52.533 --> 00:20:54.408
And, uh, yeah, that's...

275
00:20:56.616 --> 00:20:58.325
I have a sleeping disorder.

276
00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:03.283
And, yeah, well, the museum said
that they wouldn't press charges

277
00:21:03.366 --> 00:21:07.741
as long as, uh... As long
as I do it in installments. That, uh...

278
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.158
They said that I could.

279
00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:13.658
- What's this?
- It's a paperweight.

280
00:21:14.825 --> 00:21:17.825
- Where'd you get it?
- Paperweight shop.

281
00:21:27.158 --> 00:21:29.491
You're in possession
of a stolen item.

282
00:21:29.575 --> 00:21:31.158
Oh. Yeah, I...

283
00:21:32.241 --> 00:21:37.075
No. I don't have it.
I don't. No, it's not here.

284
00:21:41.658 --> 00:21:43.283
"Marc Spector"?

285
00:21:43.866 --> 00:21:46.366
- That's not mine.
- Funny that.

286
00:21:48.116 --> 00:21:49.825
Fella looks just like you.

287
00:21:50.408 --> 00:21:52.450
Fake passport and a thief.

288
00:21:52.533 --> 00:21:53.616
Tsk, tsk.

289
00:21:55.408 --> 00:21:57.408
I think you best come with us, son.

290
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:09.158
Wow. Lookie, lookie.
Guess what we've got here, Billy.

291
00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:10.991
Go on, tell me.

292
00:22:11.075 --> 00:22:14.366
We've only got ourselves
a full-blown, international fugitive.

293
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.575
It's not... It's a mistake. It's not me.

294
00:22:17.658 --> 00:22:21.741
Marc Spector was part of a team of
mercenaries that hit a dig site in Egypt.

295
00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:24.616
Here's what they did
to the archaeologists.

296
00:22:27.783 --> 00:22:32.283
Zip-tied and shot
in the back of the head, execution-style.

297
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.325
That's dark, man.

298
00:22:38.158 --> 00:22:41.033
No, no, no. I didn't do that.
That's not me.

299
00:22:41.116 --> 00:22:43.158
Of course you didn't, Steven.

300
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:04.450
I thought we were
going to the police station.

301
00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:08.450
Now, why would you think that?

302
00:23:10.158 --> 00:23:12.200
Sit tight, yeah?

303
00:23:16.575 --> 00:23:17.991
No.

304
00:23:26.408 --> 00:23:29.616
Hello. Hello! Excuse me,
could you help me?

305
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.158
Help, please. I've been kidnapped...

306
00:23:34.325 --> 00:23:35.575
She's one, too.

307
00:23:38.491 --> 00:23:39.700
Oh, my God.

308
00:23:44.575 --> 00:23:45.825
What?

309
00:23:45.908 --> 00:23:49.325
You don't need to fight me, Steven.
Surrender control.

310
00:23:49.408 --> 00:23:54.325
No. No, I saw what you did
to those people.

311
00:23:57.116 --> 00:23:59.075
- It's not what you think.
- I'm...

312
00:23:59.158 --> 00:24:03.533
I am never giving you control again.

313
00:24:03.825 --> 00:24:05.741
Ever. Do you hear me?

314
00:24:06.866 --> 00:24:10.116
I hear you loud and clear,
Steven Grant of the gift shop.

315
00:24:17.866 --> 00:24:19.200
Oh, God.

316
00:24:19.866 --> 00:24:23.658
I'm sorry for the wait.
We just needed a chance to

317
00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:26.741
better understand your situation.
Do you have the keys?

318
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.533
Let's get you out of those cuffs.
There you go.

319
00:24:30.616 --> 00:24:31.866
Thank you both.

320
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.700
- Aren't they terrific?
- Yeah, they're lovely.

321
00:24:35.783 --> 00:24:36.825
All right.

322
00:24:37.283 --> 00:24:40.950
Well, no wonder your scales don't balance.

323
00:24:41.033 --> 00:24:45.283
It must be very difficult having
all those voices inside one head.

324
00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:50.283
Steven Grant, Marc Spector, Khonshu.

325
00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:56.616
I'm curious, do you think that
Khonshu chose you as his Avatar

326
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.533
because your mind would be so easy
to break or because it was broken already?

327
00:25:02.408 --> 00:25:05.450
No, I'm not broken.

328
00:25:06.658 --> 00:25:08.200
Just need some help, maybe.

329
00:25:08.283 --> 00:25:10.908
That's right.
That's why I'm here, to help.

330
00:25:11.325 --> 00:25:14.075
Okay, what is it?
Do you see him? You see him right now?

331
00:25:14.158 --> 00:25:16.658
- That's a privilege I no longer have.
- Kill him!

332
00:25:16.741 --> 00:25:19.741
What's he saying, huh?
Is he telling you to kill me?

333
00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:23.408
- Break his windpipe!
- Yeah.

334
00:25:23.908 --> 00:25:27.033
Well, just remember,
you don't have to do everything he asks.

335
00:25:27.908 --> 00:25:30.908
So, before you get excited
and put on the cape,

336
00:25:30.991 --> 00:25:33.700
I'd love to take this opportunity
to show you around.

337
00:25:36.616 --> 00:25:41.741
It's all right, it's all right. That's all
he can do without your help. Come.

338
00:25:42.408 --> 00:25:46.575
See, this neighborhood used to have
the highest crime rate in all the city.

339
00:25:46.908 --> 00:25:49.241
There was so much suffering,
so much pain...

340
00:25:49.325 --> 00:25:52.366
Good evening. Good evening, everyone.

341
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.116
It was truly heartbreaking.

342
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.866
Now people don't lock
their doors at night. They feel safe.

343
00:25:59.075 --> 00:26:02.325
Oh, Chase, are those the tomatoes?

344
00:26:04.158 --> 00:26:08.200
You have a green thumb. Beautiful.
Thank you.

345
00:26:08.575 --> 00:26:10.783
But you don't want to tell anyone, no.

346
00:26:10.866 --> 00:26:12.616
People don't want to hear good news.

347
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.325
They'd rather cling to their fear,
cling to their pain.

348
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:18.575
- Goat...
- What? Yes.

349
00:26:22.325 --> 00:26:23.325
Ha-ha.

350
00:26:32.533 --> 00:26:35.158
- You all speak Chinese?
- Ah, Mandarin.

351
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:37.408
We all aspire to learn three languages.

352
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:40.075
So, we teach each other.
We share our knowledge.

353
00:26:44.283 --> 00:26:45.283
Wow.

354
00:26:50.741 --> 00:26:52.033
You hungry?

355
00:26:53.241 --> 00:26:54.825
The food's free.

356
00:26:55.575 --> 00:26:57.866
- You're a vegan, right?
- Yeah.

357
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.450
Yeah, so am I.

358
00:27:00.825 --> 00:27:03.908
You might wanna try the lentil soup.
I made it this morning.

359
00:27:04.033 --> 00:27:06.616
It's Victor's recipe.

360
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.325
Gracias, Victor.

361
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:13.616
He's from the Yucatan.
He's... No, he's very funny.

362
00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:16.158
Here.

363
00:27:16.241 --> 00:27:20.200
I know being on the right side of things
is important to you.

364
00:27:20.783 --> 00:27:24.950
Khonshu always tries to ensnare
those with a strong moral conscience.

365
00:27:25.033 --> 00:27:26.700
You have no conscience.

366
00:27:29.408 --> 00:27:31.241
You don't have to listen to him.

367
00:27:32.908 --> 00:27:36.575
He often throws temper tantrums,
like a two-year-old.

368
00:27:37.658 --> 00:27:39.533
None of the gods respect him.

369
00:27:41.366 --> 00:27:43.450
Perhaps that's why he's banished.

370
00:27:43.533 --> 00:27:47.241
I only punish those
who have already done harm.

371
00:27:47.325 --> 00:27:49.908
I am real justice!

372
00:27:51.741 --> 00:27:55.241
What's he saying now? "I am real justice"?

373
00:27:59.866 --> 00:28:01.575
Can you hear him?

374
00:28:02.366 --> 00:28:06.075
Not anymore. I was his former Avatar.

375
00:28:07.075 --> 00:28:11.408
Before you. I was the fist of vengeance.

376
00:28:12.533 --> 00:28:14.575
- Mmm.
- I'm not the fist of anything.

377
00:28:14.658 --> 00:28:18.033
That's the little American man living
inside of me.

378
00:28:18.116 --> 00:28:19.908
And that's, uh, that's Marc?

379
00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:25.116
Soup's... Yeah, it's very good.
It's ace. Yeah, it's lovely.

380
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.325
Khonshu punishes those
who have already walked an evil path.

381
00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:32.116
His retribution comes too late.

382
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.908
By the time his fist of vengeance arrives,

383
00:28:36.575 --> 00:28:38.408
people have already suffered.

384
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.491
Ammit knows this too well.

385
00:28:42.575 --> 00:28:44.825
She tears evil up from the root,

386
00:28:44.908 --> 00:28:47.325
casting her judgment
before any evil's done.

387
00:28:48.158 --> 00:28:50.825
- That's why we must resurrect her.
- Right.

388
00:28:50.908 --> 00:28:53.616
But... Isn't that a bit dodgy?

389
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.450
Like, trusting the judgment
of a weird crocodile lady?

390
00:28:57.783 --> 00:29:00.366
You don't need to doubt her judgment.

391
00:29:00.491 --> 00:29:05.075
Ammit will light the path to good
by eradicating the choice of evil,

392
00:29:05.158 --> 00:29:09.533
which brings us to the scarab.

393
00:29:13.783 --> 00:29:18.325
That scarab functions
as a kind of compass,

394
00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:20.533
leading us to Ammit's tomb.

395
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:26.366
She's out there, waiting,
longing to be freed.

396
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:27.533
Hi.

397
00:29:27.616 --> 00:29:32.450
While the cruel masses
deserve to face her judgment.

398
00:29:33.616 --> 00:29:35.491
And in the wake of their screams,

399
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:38.533
evil eradicated.

400
00:29:39.616 --> 00:29:41.116
Steven,

401
00:29:41.908 --> 00:29:43.866
to exist at that moment?

402
00:29:46.033 --> 00:29:47.200
Heaven on Earth.

403
00:29:49.283 --> 00:29:51.450
So, the scarab.

404
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.950
- Oh, I don't have it.
- No?

405
00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:55.283
Honestly, I don't have it.

406
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:58.241
Well, maybe you know someone who does?

407
00:29:59.783 --> 00:30:02.200
- Maybe Marc?
- Don't you do it.

408
00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:06.116
Don't you say her name.
Do not give Layla up.

409
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.700
Just give me the body.

410
00:30:08.575 --> 00:30:11.408
- No, I don't.
- May I speak with Marc?

411
00:30:11.908 --> 00:30:13.075
Um, uh...

412
00:30:13.158 --> 00:30:16.116
Marc,
what has Khonshu promised you?

413
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.866
That this is your last mission?
Then you'll be free?

414
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:24.533
Trust me when
I tell you Khonshu is a liar.

415
00:30:24.616 --> 00:30:27.075
There's always one last thing.

416
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.783
Sorry. If Ammit judges people pre-evil,
like, before the fact,

417
00:30:35.908 --> 00:30:38.366
then, isn't she judging
an innocent person?

418
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.825
I mean, a thought can't be evil, can it?

419
00:30:41.908 --> 00:30:44.658
I think about killing
my boss all the time,

420
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:47.200
- but I wouldn't actually do it.
- Steven...

421
00:30:47.283 --> 00:30:51.741
What about a child? Would she kill a child
for something they might do in 30 years?

422
00:30:53.075 --> 00:30:54.741
I'm glad you mentioned that.

423
00:30:56.533 --> 00:31:00.950
Sometimes, the cure is
a little taste of the disease.

424
00:31:01.741 --> 00:31:05.908
The difference between medicine
and poison sometimes is only dosage.

425
00:31:06.325 --> 00:31:08.533
Consider a diseased limb.

426
00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:12.783
Amputation, horrific and grotesque,

427
00:31:13.491 --> 00:31:16.575
is necessary for the larger health.

428
00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:20.033
But the child is not a diseased limb.

429
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:23.283
Sorry, is that... Is that what...

430
00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:27.908
You're all into that, like,
killing children and that?

431
00:31:28.283 --> 00:31:30.075
Maybe that's just me, but that's...

432
00:31:30.158 --> 00:31:34.158
I kind of draw a line there
at child murder.

433
00:31:40.575 --> 00:31:41.950
Do you know what this is?

434
00:31:44.158 --> 00:31:47.408
- Yep. It's a cane, yeah.
- This is...

435
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.783
Ammit's gift to her first Avatar.

436
00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:54.825
All right.

437
00:31:56.866 --> 00:31:58.241
It contains in it

438
00:31:59.491 --> 00:32:02.741
a tiny sliver of her power.

439
00:32:03.741 --> 00:32:05.116
I don't wanna use it.

440
00:32:07.033 --> 00:32:09.158
- I don't.
- Then don't.

441
00:32:10.825 --> 00:32:13.200
- I can't help you.
- Yes, you can.

442
00:32:13.283 --> 00:32:17.366
I need to know, where is the scarab?

443
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.366
Where is the scarab?

444
00:32:22.575 --> 00:32:25.991
- Where is the scarab?
- No.

445
00:32:26.075 --> 00:32:28.658
- Where's the scarab?
- I have it.

446
00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:41.783
You couldn't possibly understand
the value of what you're holding.

447
00:32:43.283 --> 00:32:45.200
Let me have that, I'll keep it safe.

448
00:32:45.283 --> 00:32:50.158
There is no deal in this, Marc.
Fix this. Fix this!

449
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:52.825
Summon the suit.

450
00:32:53.741 --> 00:32:55.241
Sorry, what?

451
00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:58.533
Summon the suit.

452
00:32:58.616 --> 00:33:01.134
- "Summon the soup"? What are you saying?
- The suit. Summon it.

453
00:33:01.158 --> 00:33:02.878
- The suit?
- And keep this safe.

454
00:33:03.533 --> 00:33:05.325
- So be it.
- Let's go, let's go.

455
00:33:06.283 --> 00:33:07.325
Get off, get off her!

456
00:33:15.866 --> 00:33:17.575
Steven!

457
00:33:35.158 --> 00:33:36.241
That was awesome.

458
00:33:53.325 --> 00:33:55.616
Here. Bolt the door.

459
00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:01.075
Oh, my God.

460
00:34:02.658 --> 00:34:05.033
I'm going to die
in an evil magician's man cave.

461
00:34:05.116 --> 00:34:08.283
No. Hey. Listen to me. Listen to me.

462
00:34:08.366 --> 00:34:10.658
Your name is Marc. There's a suit.

463
00:34:10.741 --> 00:34:14.241
- I've seen you use it. You bring it out.
- No.

464
00:34:14.325 --> 00:34:16.842
- Where are you? We need you to fight.
- Let me in, Steven!

465
00:34:16.866 --> 00:34:19.950
- No. I can't. Stop, please, both of you.
- Let me in. There's no more time.

466
00:34:20.033 --> 00:34:23.283
- Please, stop.
- Listen to me. Your name is Marc.

467
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:27.200
Bring it out!

468
00:34:27.283 --> 00:34:29.491
Let me in. Let me in.

469
00:34:30.616 --> 00:34:31.950
Let me in, Steven.

470
00:34:32.033 --> 00:34:35.158
Where the hell are you? You need to fight!

471
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:37.575
Please stop.
Leave me alone, both of you!

472
00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:38.700
Hey!

473
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:41.700
You can do this, I promise.

474
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.241
Steven...

475
00:34:46.866 --> 00:34:49.241
I can't. I can't.

476
00:34:49.325 --> 00:34:52.575
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do it.

477
00:34:52.658 --> 00:34:55.200
It's all right. Okay.

478
00:34:55.283 --> 00:34:57.825
We'll just find another way.

479
00:34:58.866 --> 00:35:00.491
Come on. Come on, let's go.

480
00:35:06.075 --> 00:35:07.575
Jackal. Jackal. Jackal!

481
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.366
What jackal?

482
00:35:09.866 --> 00:35:11.825
Jackal. Jackal...

483
00:35:15.158 --> 00:35:16.658
Summon the suit!

484
00:35:16.741 --> 00:35:17.741
Suit!

485
00:35:33.241 --> 00:35:34.991
That should have been much worse.

486
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.533
Oy, Steven,
what the hell are we wearing?

487
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:41.116
I don't know.
She said I needed a suit.

488
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.116
Yeah, the ceremonial armor from Khonshu's
temple, not psycho Colonel Sanders.

489
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.075
Well, I don't know how
any of this shit works, man. I...

490
00:35:48.533 --> 00:35:50.533
Well, think I do look sharp, though.

491
00:35:50.616 --> 00:35:53.616
- All right, where is the scarab?
- Scarab... Oh, um...

492
00:35:56.116 --> 00:35:58.533
What's this?
What are these little poles for?

493
00:36:00.408 --> 00:36:02.075
Pretty cool, actually.

494
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:04.991
Ha. I like this.

495
00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:27.658
You look different.

496
00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:37.450
- Stay away from me!
- Wait, wh...

497
00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:33.116
Give me control, Steven.
You can't handle this.

498
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.075
I think I can.
Get away from her, you.

499
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.075
Yeah, I see you, you plug-ugly coyote.

500
00:37:42.283 --> 00:37:46.075
You're in the wrong ends, mate.
You're in my yard now.

501
00:37:46.283 --> 00:37:50.200
Yeah. Come on. Come on.
That's right. Come on.

502
00:37:51.491 --> 00:37:53.533
Ooh, lookie here. Lookie here.

503
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.533
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,
my name is Steven with a V.

504
00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:03.325
Oh, my God. Here you come, come on!

505
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.825
What?

506
00:38:08.575 --> 00:38:11.533
I did it! You got planted!

507
00:38:11.616 --> 00:38:13.658
Layla, Layla! Did you see that?

508
00:38:20.116 --> 00:38:22.241
Do you reckon he's havin' a seizure?

509
00:38:22.325 --> 00:38:25.241
Nah, look at him.
He's just a fancy drunk.

510
00:38:27.408 --> 00:38:29.491
Oh!

511
00:38:53.075 --> 00:38:55.366
That was a hell of a punch back there.

512
00:38:56.408 --> 00:38:57.950
Look around.

513
00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.533
Someone's gonna get hurt
if you don't let me help.

514
00:39:01.783 --> 00:39:05.033
All right. Do it. Take control. For now.

515
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.866
Get it out of here.

516
00:40:04.033 --> 00:40:05.950
Come on. Come on.

517
00:40:06.825 --> 00:40:08.616
That's it. Just a little further.

518
00:40:08.783 --> 00:40:10.200
Gotcha!

519
00:40:43.283 --> 00:40:45.700
No, no. Where is it? Where is it?

520
00:40:46.075 --> 00:40:47.075
Shit!

521
00:40:48.075 --> 00:40:49.491
Shit!

522
00:40:57.491 --> 00:40:59.408
I'm sorry, but that belongs to me.

523
00:41:00.408 --> 00:41:03.575
I can offer you food, clothing,

524
00:41:03.825 --> 00:41:06.866
but I am unable
to offer you this. Thank you.

525
00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.783
I wish you could live
to see the world we make.

526
00:41:44.033 --> 00:41:45.658
So, this is what it's like?

527
00:41:47.116 --> 00:41:48.533
Being on the inside?

528
00:41:52.408 --> 00:41:53.408
Yeah.

529
00:41:55.325 --> 00:41:57.783
- It's horrible.
- It's all right. You're all right.

530
00:42:01.991 --> 00:42:05.116
- I feel like I can scarcely move.
- It's all right, just breathe through it.

531
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.366
It gets easier.

532
00:42:07.325 --> 00:42:09.158
How long have you been doing this?

533
00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:15.325
I don't know. It's... A long time.

534
00:42:15.408 --> 00:42:16.991
- I don't like it.
- Long time.

535
00:42:17.533 --> 00:42:20.616
I don't want it. Can I have my body back?

536
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.200
- I can't do that right now, Steven.
- Please.

537
00:42:23.783 --> 00:42:24.991
I'm taking it back.

538
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:32.783
Sorry.

539
00:42:32.866 --> 00:42:35.866
We've always managed to keep a wall
between us, but something's changed.

540
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:39.491
The one who controls the body
has become stronger.

541
00:42:40.033 --> 00:42:42.491
The reflections help,
but most of the time,

542
00:42:42.575 --> 00:42:45.325
it'll take all your willpower
just to be a fly on the wall.

543
00:42:45.408 --> 00:42:49.408
You can't do this, keeping me
trapped in here. You have no right.

544
00:42:50.366 --> 00:42:51.658
My whole life...

545
00:42:52.116 --> 00:42:55.408
I can't go on a bloody date.
I can barely keep a goldfish alive.

546
00:42:55.491 --> 00:42:58.616
I lost my job. It's been you.
It's always been you,

547
00:42:59.241 --> 00:43:02.116
eating away at parts of my life
like a parasite.

548
00:43:02.575 --> 00:43:05.991
Look, when I am done,
when I have repaid my debt,

549
00:43:06.075 --> 00:43:09.450
I swear to you, you will never
see me or hear from me again.

550
00:43:09.908 --> 00:43:13.950
I promise you. We wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for Khonshu. And my...

551
00:43:15.658 --> 00:43:18.450
servitude is the price that I pay.

552
00:43:19.408 --> 00:43:22.491
- What kind of servitude?
- The kind that leaves me covered in blood.

553
00:43:22.575 --> 00:43:25.116
Yeah, well, that blood is on my hands.

554
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.950
You ruin people's lives.
Everything you touch, you ruin.

555
00:43:28.033 --> 00:43:31.283
You hurt people, you abandoned
your wife. You left her stranded.

556
00:43:31.366 --> 00:43:34.366
I did not. I am protecting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.

557
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:36.950
- Yes, you did. I saw.
- Khonshu has his eyes on her.

558
00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:40.033
He wants her as my replacement.
I'm never gonna let that happen.

559
00:43:40.116 --> 00:43:42.533
You're a liar. I don't believe you.
I don't trust you.

560
00:43:42.616 --> 00:43:44.825
- You hurt people.
- I'm never letting him near her.

561
00:43:44.908 --> 00:43:47.075
- Just shut up!
- I won't let you hurt anyone again.

562
00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:50.533
I will never give you
a moment of peace, I promise.

563
00:43:50.616 --> 00:43:52.366
Shut up!

564
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:56.533
You shut up! Shut up!

565
00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:17.575
You swore
he would not interfere.

566
00:44:18.658 --> 00:44:20.950
I know. I'll handle it.

567
00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:24.116
- You have proven you cannot.
- I will.

568
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.658
Ungrateful, Marc,
altering the terms of our agreement.

569
00:44:29.741 --> 00:44:33.575
You were nothing more
than a corpse when I found you.

570
00:44:33.658 --> 00:44:38.200
You think you own this body?

571
00:44:40.658 --> 00:44:44.408
- It belongs to me.
- We'll find the scarab.

572
00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:48.533
Too late. Harrow has it.

573
00:44:50.616 --> 00:44:52.158
Then we'll find another way.

574
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:54.491
We'll get to Ammit's tomb first.

575
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.116
You know I'll protect you
with everything I have.

576
00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:04.700
- You are worth protecting.
- I'll do whatever it takes then.

577
00:45:05.283 --> 00:45:06.616
Then you let me go.

578
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.450
I know that you enjoy the work
I have for you.

579
00:45:10.158 --> 00:45:12.866
- We need each other.
- We have a deal.

580
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:18.241
Let me remind you, should we part,
you may not like my next candidate,

581
00:45:18.325 --> 00:45:22.575
near and dear as she is to you.

582
00:45:28.533 --> 00:45:29.741
Where are we going?

583
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.408
Where the hell do you think?

584
00:50:33.991 --> 00:50:35.676
For information on
mental health resources near you,
