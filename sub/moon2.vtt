00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.767
- It's maddening, isn't it?
- Hello?

2
00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:11.458
The voice in your head.

3
00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:15.416
Relentless, forever unsatisfied.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.083
What's this?

5
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.083
Layla.

6
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.875
- Oh, my God, you're alive.
- Yeah, all right.

7
00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.208
That's it? I've been texting
and calling you for months.

8
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:30.083
My body wants to get up
and wander about, you know?

9
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:34.041
And I don't even know about it
until I wake up wherever.

10
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.791
Strange, innit?

11
00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:39.458
I strongly encourage you to return that.

12
00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:40.791
Here, take it.

13
00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:42.916
That was so strange. Sorry about...

14
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.375
I will not ask again.

15
00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:46.916
Oh, my God!

16
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:49.833
You're not gonna die.

17
00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:53.041
Let me save us.

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

19
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.708
No, no, no.

20
00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:13.125
You there?

21
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:14.625
Hmm?

22
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.375
No?

23
00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:21.541
Yeah, didn't think so.

24
00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:51.583
Bruv, hey.

25
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:54.541
Oh, hey. Bro, it is proper mad in here.

26
00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.000
What happened? What is it?

27
00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:59.958
They're saying burst pipes,
but don't look like that to me.

28
00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:03.125
Has anyone seen the security footage?

29
00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.583
Well, yeah, I was about to.

30
00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:09.458
All right. I think
I should go with you, yeah?

31
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.958
I may have some information about it.

32
00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:15.958
- All right, come on.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:19.375
Do not tell Donna
that I let you into this arena.

34
00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:22.416
Bruv, listen, I must warn you.

35
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.458
What you're about to see
is gonna melt your brain. Yeah?

36
00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:28.041
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

37
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:32.833
It's like Area 51,
like MI6 bonkers, bruv. Yeah?

38
00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:35.083
- All right. All right, mate.
- You ready?

39
00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:36.208
Yeah.

40
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.000
Roll the tape.

41
00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:43.416
Is that you, Scotty?

42
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:47.541
Still Steven.
And yeah, that's me. Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.458
Watch, here it comes.

44
00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:52.166
Are you cryin'?

45
00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:56.541
A bit. Yeah, a bit.
Watch, here it comes. Wait for it.

46
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.250
Wait for it.

47
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.625
How long am I waitin'?

48
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:04.206
Different angle, yeah?
Different, different.

49
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:07.375
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Wait for it, here it comes.

50
00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:09.875
No, no, no, wait.

51
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.750
Why are you going in...
What are you doing, you donut?

52
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.708
No, just a minute. Here it comes.

53
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.490
Wait, wait. Now, just a minute.

54
00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:19.791
- You messed up the loos.
- Shh. I don't...

55
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:21.166
- Mate!
- Oh, God.

56
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.000
Larry in Maintenance
is gonna absolutely shoot you.

57
00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:27.916
I swear to God, there was
a dog chasing me, like a big hound, or...

58
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.375
Hound of the Baskervilles, was it?

59
00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:32.250
- Egyptian jackal. It was a jackal.
- I've heard it all now.

60
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:37.291
Oh, God. Oh, God.

61
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:41.166
Fast forward till when I come out.
When I come out.

62
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.750
Oh, yeah, why not, yeah.

63
00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.291
Let me do it.

64
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.750
- Now, there. Have a look.
- Yeah, yeah...

65
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.625
It's still you, bruv.

66
00:04:57.083 --> 00:04:58.208
That's not me.

67
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:12.041
I should tell you, the museum
has no wish to press charges.

68
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.625
- Okay.
- But Mr. Grant,

69
00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.583
we've spoken to your colleagues.

70
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.291
Yeah?

71
00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:22.958
It's all been a bit of a struggle
for you recently, hey?

72
00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.000
Yeah. A bit, a bit.

73
00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:31.791
This particular group of doctors
has a long-standing relationship with us.

74
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.500
Doctors?

75
00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:36.208
Oh.

76
00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:41.166
They're wonderful.

77
00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.041
- Yeah?
- I could arrange an appointment.

78
00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:46.791
Okay. Yeah.

79
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.041
It looks...
It actually looks quite posh.

80
00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:53.416
Looks like they're
very good listeners, right?

81
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:54.625
They really are.

82
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.791
I know this is classic HR to say, but...

83
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.583
But you're not alone.

84
00:06:03.541 --> 00:06:05.916
Yeah. That's, like,
part of the problem, innit?

85
00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:11.083
Before you leave us,
I'm sorry for the protocol of it, but...

86
00:06:11.291 --> 00:06:13.375
Any museum property on your person?

87
00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:16.916
No, I haven't nicked anything.
I swear. I...

88
00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:24.125
No, nothing.

89
00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:26.416
Uh...

90
00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:32.916
Yeah.

91
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.708
Well, that's it. I got the sack.

92
00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:50.750
I don't blame 'em. I'm a vandal.
I should've been arrested.

93
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:58.458
I did find things hidden in my flat.

94
00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:00.875
I swear. I'm not joking.

95
00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:04.833
That's worth exploring, isn't it?

96
00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:07.416
Like, if I could find that storage locker,

97
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.000
that might be my one chance
to prove to myself that I'm not mad.

98
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:16.666
Oh, mate, thank you. Thanks. Cheers.

99
00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:27.416
- Hiya.
- Hey.

100
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.666
- You all right?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.791
Yeah. Um, look, man, this is, like,
the fifth branch I've been to.

102
00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:35.750
I'm looking for my storage locker.
It's under "Steven Grant."

103
00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:38.958
If it's not under Steven Grant,
it might be under "Marc."

104
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.250
I don't have a surname, just Marc.

105
00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:45.000
Would you have a look for me,
if that's all right?

106
00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:49.458
- I know it sounds...
- Of course. I know you. #43, right?

107
00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:51.541
I never forget a face.

108
00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:56.666
All right.

109
00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:18.750
Oh, my God.

110
00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:44.250
"Marc Spector."

111
00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:54.416
No way.

112
00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:59.541
It's real. It's totally real.

113
00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:07.625
Whoa.

114
00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:16.625
I'd say you are a compass,
but you're not pointing north.

115
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:21.791
Steven, I need you
to listen to me very carefully.

116
00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:22.875
Marc?

117
00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:25.708
There he is. Here he comes.

118
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:29.833
Hello, man in the mirror.
I was wondering if you'd pop up again.

119
00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:31.791
- I know you're scared.
- A bit, yeah.

120
00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:34.392
I know you're confused.
You weren't supposed to see any of this.

121
00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:36.208
No? Well, bit late for that, innit?

122
00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:40.500
So, what? Am I, like, meant to be some
sort of mad secret agent or something?

123
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.291
It's a little more complicated than that.

124
00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.708
More complicated? What? Am I possessed?

125
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:48.791
- Are you, like, a demon? Or...
- You're in danger, and I can save us,

126
00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:50.833
just like I did last night.

127
00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:54.375
But I can't have you interfering
in what I have left to do.

128
00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:57.083
So, this is what's gonna happen.

129
00:10:57.166 --> 00:10:59.583
You're gonna go lay down
on that cot back there.

130
00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.791
- You're gonna take a nice nap.
- Are you joking?

131
00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:05.750
Sleep... I'm never gonna
go to sleep again. You hear me?

132
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:10.125
Look, I don't care
how bloody handsome you are.

133
00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:14.000
Tell me what it is you are. What are you?

134
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.125
- You sure you want to know?
- Yes, bloody... Yes.

135
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.208
I serve Khonshu. I'm his Avatar.

136
00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.750
Which means you are, too. Sort of.

137
00:11:26.208 --> 00:11:28.833
We protect the vulnerable

138
00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:32.500
and deliver Khonshu's justice
to those who hurt them.

139
00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:34.083
- Khonshu?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:36.166
The Egyptian god of the moon?

141
00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:41.000
Oh, my God, that's
the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

142
00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:44.083
I eat one piece of steak, and then, bam,
I go bonkers.

143
00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:48.083
Oh, God. I'm having a panic attack.

144
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.833
- I made a deal with Khonshu.
- I need to go to hospital.

145
00:11:51.916 --> 00:11:55.083
That deal is contingent
on you not interfering, Steven.

146
00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:59.833
Now, give me the body. Let me finish this,
and you'll never hear from me again.

147
00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:02.833
You want my body? Right, yeah.

148
00:12:02.916 --> 00:12:07.750
Marc, how about this for a deal? I'm gonna
take this bag full of illegal shit, yeah?

149
00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:10.083
And I'm gonna go
straight to the authorities.

150
00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:13.208
And they're gonna put me away
so I don't hurt anyone else.

151
00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:17.166
And hopefully, NHS will
fill me with enough pills

152
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.125
so that you get out of my head!

153
00:12:37.583 --> 00:12:39.375
Oh, God. Oh, God.

154
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.541
Give it back, you fool.

155
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.166
Marc? Where have you been?

156
00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.000
Layla?

157
00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:40.291
What the hell is going on? Is this
Steven the latest fake identity for you?

158
00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:43.708
I figured you were using a coded message
when we spoke on the phone.

159
00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:44.875
How did you find me?

160
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.833
How'd you think?
I tracked your phone.

161
00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:49.625
I thought you wanted me
to do that when you turned it on.

162
00:13:49.708 --> 00:13:51.000
Right. Yeah.

163
00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:55.041
You know, you really could have
given me any sign that you were alive.

164
00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:57.833
I thought that you were in danger,
or kidnapped again.

165
00:13:57.916 --> 00:14:00.125
I just kept thinking,
"He's got the suit. He's fine."

166
00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:03.500
Then, I thought, "Well, what if he gets
ambushed when he's not wearing it?"

167
00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:05.291
And "What if he doesn't have it?" And...

168
00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:08.333
- Stop clasping my shoulder like that.
- I don't know where to hold.

169
00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:10.333
Feels like riding
with a Victorian duchess.

170
00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:11.500
Where do I hang on?

171
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.083
Do you see the spiral you put me through?

172
00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:24.875
It's not okay, yeah? I'm still your wife.

173
00:14:26.708 --> 00:14:30.458
By the way, this would be a great time
for you to say something. Anything.

174
00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:33.541
- Just in case it's not clear.
- Sorry, sorry... Did you say wife?

175
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.125
My... Are we married?

176
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.750
Look, I'm pretty sure
we lost whoever was chasing you.

177
00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:41.166
- Just drop the act.
- It's not an act. I...

178
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.708
- Stop with the accent, please.
- This is how I talk.

179
00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:48.625
- Okay. Get off the bike.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Please.

180
00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:52.125
Please, I will tell you everything,
just get me to my flat, yeah?

181
00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:54.541
Just get me home.

182
00:15:03.916 --> 00:15:04.916
All right.

183
00:15:21.416 --> 00:15:22.666
She shouldn't be here.

184
00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:26.916
Get her out of here, Steven.
You're way out of your depth.

185
00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:30.333
I just want my life back.

186
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.041
Yeah, I'm getting that.

187
00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:37.875
No. Sorry, I wasn't talking to you,
just talking to myself. Sort of.

188
00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.291
- Uh, this is your flat, Marc?
- Um, I'm Steven.

189
00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.958
Are you living here with someone else?

190
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.875
No, no, no.

191
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.416
No, this is my mum's flat.

192
00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:53.583
Okay, so you guys are talking again?

193
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.500
Mmm-hmm.

194
00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:02.833
Marceline Desbordes-Valmore?

195
00:16:04.083 --> 00:16:05.166
Yep.

196
00:16:18.083 --> 00:16:19.125
Oui, oui.

197
00:16:20.791 --> 00:16:22.291
She's my favorite poet.

198
00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:26.083
Um, no, she's my favorite.

199
00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:29.208
That's mental.

200
00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:35.166
So, you're learning
French and hieroglyphics?

201
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.208
Yeah, well...
That's not that impressive, really.

202
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.875
It's not like hieroglyphs
are a whole language.

203
00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.666
- It's more like a...
- Like an alphabet.

204
00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:48.041
Yeah, and... Well, you still have to know

205
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.875
- ancient Egyptian to read it.
- Sure.

206
00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:54.791
- For example, like this one here, right?
- Funeral rites.

207
00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:00.833
Well, someone knows
their unilaterals. You.

208
00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:04.500
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

209
00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:10.833
- Sorry, I don't mean that in a creepy way.
- No, I'm sorry. I'm not buying this, Marc.

210
00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:12.916
Use whatever accent you want. Yeah.

211
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.250
Let's just get this over with. You sent
these papers but you never signed them.

212
00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:19.416
Did I? Uh...

213
00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:22.458
This is what you wanted.

214
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.083
Have a look here.

215
00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:28.375
After everything, you told me
that we needed to move on.

216
00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:32.583
All right. Divo... Divorce?

217
00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.500
Yeah, we doing this or not?

218
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:38.375
I would never divorce you.

219
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.291
What are you doing?

220
00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:49.666
Look, you seem absolutely lovely.

221
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:55.125
This Marc, on the other hand,
is a right twit. Yeah?

222
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.708
I don't know how to explain
what's been happening.

223
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:01.875
- Steven.
- I don't expect you to believe me.

224
00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.041
- Steven, listen to me.
- I honestly don't really believe myself.

225
00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.791
- All I can do is try to...
- You're making a mistake.

226
00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:09.791
- ...try to show you what I found.
- Steve...

227
00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:13.416
- I found this bag in the storage locker.
- Steven, don't... Listen to me.

228
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.791
- Inside of it is all sorts...
- Stop what you're doing right now.

229
00:18:16.875 --> 00:18:19.000
- ...of things.
- Don't show her what's in the bag.

230
00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:22.333
- Most interestingly...
- You're gonna get her killed. You hear me?

231
00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.375
Most interestingly is what?

232
00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:29.666
You show her that scarab, you're
responsible when they come after her.

233
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.708
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

234
00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.208
Nothing. Never mind.

235
00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:35.458
- What's in there?
- Nothing... Wait, wait...

236
00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:37.875
Bloody hell.

237
00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:45.791
The scarab pointing to Ammit's ushabti?
What we fought side by side for.

238
00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:48.666
- No...
- This whole one-man show is just what?

239
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.750
So that you can keep it for yourself?

240
00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:52.875
- No. I swear...
- After all we've been...

241
00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:57.041
Just stop! I'm supposed to believe
anything you say with this shoved in

242
00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:59.916
- what, a gym bag?
- Take it. Take it, you can have it.

243
00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:05.041
Take it. I don't want it. I don't want it.
I swear. Have it.

244
00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:09.875
I am not Marc Spector.

245
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:15.458
I'm Steven Grant. I work in a gift shop.
Well, I used to work in a gift shop.

246
00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:19.250
And I think I'm in real danger,

247
00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:22.833
and I think maybe that you might be
the only person that can help me.

248
00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:26.333
Please.

249
00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:31.083
You really don't remember
why we've been looking for this?

250
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:34.041
Our adventures.

251
00:19:35.916 --> 00:19:37.958
Or our life together?

252
00:19:39.791 --> 00:19:41.166
Oh, God, I wish I could.

253
00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:45.666
Steven Grant, can we have a word?

254
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.458
See? Oh, God, they've come for me.

255
00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:51.666
- Why?
- I vandalized the toilet.

256
00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.458
Yeah, just a minute.

257
00:19:57.291 --> 00:19:58.541
Steven Grant?

258
00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:01.125
- Yeah?
- DC Fitzgerald and DC Kennedy here.

259
00:20:01.208 --> 00:20:02.666
Yeah, one second.

260
00:20:05.916 --> 00:20:08.041
Hello, officers.

261
00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:09.583
Steven Grant?

262
00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:14.375
I think so, yeah. I mean, yep, yes.

263
00:20:14.458 --> 00:20:16.458
That's me, 100% Steven Grant.

264
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.958
Sorry, I was just havin' a bit of a day.

265
00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:24.434
Mind if we come in, Mr. Grant?

266
00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:27.791
- Oh, um, actually, right now isn't...
- Appreciate it.

267
00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:30.250
Anyone else here with you?

268
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:34.125
Uh, here with me? No, just me and my fish.

269
00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:35.291
Yeah.

270
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.791
So, um...

271
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.625
Yeah.

272
00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.833
Is this about the toilet?

273
00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:49.250
'Cause it's been dealt with.
Yeah. I've been sacked.

274
00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:51.208
And, uh, yeah, that's...

275
00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:55.125
I have a sleeping disorder.

276
00:20:56.125 --> 00:21:00.083
And, yeah, well, the museum said
that they wouldn't press charges

277
00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:04.541
as long as, uh... As long
as I do it in installments. That, uh...

278
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.958
They said that I could.

279
00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:10.458
- What's this?
- It's a paperweight.

280
00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:14.625
- Where'd you get it?
- Paperweight shop.

281
00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:26.291
You're in possession
of a stolen item.

282
00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:27.958
Oh. Yeah, I...

283
00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:33.875
No. I don't have it.
I don't. No, it's not here.

284
00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:40.083
"Marc Spector"?

285
00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:43.166
- That's not mine.
- Funny that.

286
00:21:44.916 --> 00:21:46.625
Fella looks just like you.

287
00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:49.250
Fake passport and a thief.

288
00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:50.416
Tsk, tsk.

289
00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:54.208
I think you best come with us, son.

290
00:22:02.333 --> 00:22:05.958
Wow. Lookie, lookie.
Guess what we've got here, Billy.

291
00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.791
Go on, tell me.

292
00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:11.166
We've only got ourselves
a full-blown, international fugitive.

293
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.375
It's not... It's a mistake. It's not me.

294
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:18.541
Marc Spector was part of a team of
mercenaries that hit a dig site in Egypt.

295
00:22:19.208 --> 00:22:21.416
Here's what they did
to the archaeologists.

296
00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:29.083
Zip-tied and shot
in the back of the head, execution-style.

297
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.125
That's dark, man.

298
00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.833
No, no, no. I didn't do that.
That's not me.

299
00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:39.958
Of course you didn't, Steven.

300
00:22:58.791 --> 00:23:01.250
I thought we were
going to the police station.

301
00:23:03.416 --> 00:23:05.250
Now, why would you think that?

302
00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:09.000
Sit tight, yeah?

303
00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:14.791
No.

304
00:23:23.208 --> 00:23:26.416
Hello. Hello! Excuse me,
could you help me?

305
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.958
Help, please. I've been kidnapped...

306
00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:32.375
She's one, too.

307
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:36.500
Oh, my God.

308
00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:42.625
What?

309
00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:46.125
You don't need to fight me, Steven.
Surrender control.

310
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:51.125
No. No, I saw what you did
to those people.

311
00:23:53.916 --> 00:23:55.875
- It's not what you think.
- I'm...

312
00:23:55.958 --> 00:24:00.333
I am never giving you control again.

313
00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:02.541
Ever. Do you hear me?

314
00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:06.916
I hear you loud and clear,
Steven Grant of the gift shop.

315
00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:16.000
Oh, God.

316
00:24:16.666 --> 00:24:20.458
I'm sorry for the wait.
We just needed a chance to

317
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:23.541
better understand your situation.
Do you have the keys?

318
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.333
Let's get you out of those cuffs.
There you go.

319
00:24:27.416 --> 00:24:28.666
Thank you both.

320
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.500
- Aren't they terrific?
- Yeah, they're lovely.

321
00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:33.625
All right.

322
00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:37.750
Well, no wonder your scales don't balance.

323
00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:42.083
It must be very difficult having
all those voices inside one head.

324
00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:47.083
Steven Grant, Marc Spector, Khonshu.

325
00:24:48.416 --> 00:24:53.416
I'm curious, do you think that
Khonshu chose you as his Avatar

326
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.333
because your mind would be so easy
to break or because it was broken already?

327
00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:02.250
No, I'm not broken.

328
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:05.000
Just need some help, maybe.

329
00:25:05.083 --> 00:25:07.708
That's right.
That's why I'm here, to help.

330
00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:10.875
Okay, what is it?
Do you see him? You see him right now?

331
00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:13.458
- That's a privilege I no longer have.
- Kill him!

332
00:25:13.541 --> 00:25:16.541
What's he saying, huh?
Is he telling you to kill me?

333
00:25:17.166 --> 00:25:20.208
- Break his windpipe!
- Yeah.

334
00:25:20.708 --> 00:25:23.833
Well, just remember,
you don't have to do everything he asks.

335
00:25:24.708 --> 00:25:27.708
So, before you get excited
and put on the cape,

336
00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:30.500
I'd love to take this opportunity
to show you around.

337
00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:38.541
It's all right, it's all right. That's all
he can do without your help. Come.

338
00:25:39.208 --> 00:25:43.375
See, this neighborhood used to have
the highest crime rate in all the city.

339
00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.041
There was so much suffering,
so much pain...

340
00:25:46.125 --> 00:25:49.166
Good evening. Good evening, everyone.

341
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.916
It was truly heartbreaking.

342
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.666
Now people don't lock
their doors at night. They feel safe.

343
00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:59.125
Oh, Chase, are those the tomatoes?

344
00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:05.000
You have a green thumb. Beautiful.
Thank you.

345
00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:07.583
But you don't want to tell anyone, no.

346
00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:09.416
People don't want to hear good news.

347
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.125
They'd rather cling to their fear,
cling to their pain.

348
00:26:13.291 --> 00:26:15.375
- Goat...
- What? Yes.

349
00:26:19.125 --> 00:26:20.125
Ha-ha.

350
00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:31.958
- You all speak Chinese?
- Ah, Mandarin.

351
00:26:32.041 --> 00:26:34.208
We all aspire to learn three languages.

352
00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:36.875
So, we teach each other.
We share our knowledge.

353
00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:42.083
Wow.

354
00:26:47.541 --> 00:26:48.833
You hungry?

355
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.625
The food's free.

356
00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:54.666
- You're a vegan, right?
- Yeah.

357
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.250
Yeah, so am I.

358
00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:00.708
You might wanna try the lentil soup.
I made it this morning.

359
00:27:00.833 --> 00:27:03.416
It's Victor's recipe.

360
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.125
Gracias, Victor.

361
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:10.416
He's from the Yucatan.
He's... No, he's very funny.

362
00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:12.958
Here.

363
00:27:13.041 --> 00:27:17.000
I know being on the right side of things
is important to you.

364
00:27:17.583 --> 00:27:21.750
Khonshu always tries to ensnare
those with a strong moral conscience.

365
00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:23.500
You have no conscience.

366
00:27:26.208 --> 00:27:28.041
You don't have to listen to him.

367
00:27:29.708 --> 00:27:33.375
He often throws temper tantrums,
like a two-year-old.

368
00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:36.333
None of the gods respect him.

369
00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:40.250
Perhaps that's why he's banished.

370
00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:44.041
I only punish those
who have already done harm.

371
00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:46.708
I am real justice!

372
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:52.041
What's he saying now? "I am real justice"?

373
00:27:56.666 --> 00:27:58.375
Can you hear him?

374
00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:02.875
Not anymore. I was his former Avatar.

375
00:28:03.875 --> 00:28:08.208
Before you. I was the fist of vengeance.

376
00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:11.375
- Mmm.
- I'm not the fist of anything.

377
00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:14.833
That's the little American man living
inside of me.

378
00:28:14.916 --> 00:28:16.708
And that's, uh, that's Marc?

379
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:21.916
Soup's... Yeah, it's very good.
It's ace. Yeah, it's lovely.

380
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.125
Khonshu punishes those
who have already walked an evil path.

381
00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:28.916
His retribution comes too late.

382
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.708
By the time his fist of vengeance arrives,

383
00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:35.208
people have already suffered.

384
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.291
Ammit knows this too well.

385
00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:41.625
She tears evil up from the root,

386
00:28:41.708 --> 00:28:44.125
casting her judgment
before any evil's done.

387
00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:47.625
- That's why we must resurrect her.
- Right.

388
00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:50.416
But... Isn't that a bit dodgy?

389
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.250
Like, trusting the judgment
of a weird crocodile lady?

390
00:28:54.583 --> 00:28:57.166
You don't need to doubt her judgment.

391
00:28:57.291 --> 00:29:01.875
Ammit will light the path to good
by eradicating the choice of evil,

392
00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:06.333
which brings us to the scarab.

393
00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:15.125
That scarab functions
as a kind of compass,

394
00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:17.333
leading us to Ammit's tomb.

395
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:23.166
She's out there, waiting,
longing to be freed.

396
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.333
Hi.

397
00:29:24.416 --> 00:29:29.250
While the cruel masses
deserve to face her judgment.

398
00:29:30.416 --> 00:29:32.291
And in the wake of their screams,

399
00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:35.333
evil eradicated.

400
00:29:36.416 --> 00:29:37.916
Steven,

401
00:29:38.708 --> 00:29:40.666
to exist at that moment?

402
00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:44.000
Heaven on Earth.

403
00:29:46.083 --> 00:29:48.250
So, the scarab.

404
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.750
- Oh, I don't have it.
- No?

405
00:29:50.833 --> 00:29:52.083
Honestly, I don't have it.

406
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:55.041
Well, maybe you know someone who does?

407
00:29:56.583 --> 00:29:59.000
- Maybe Marc?
- Don't you do it.

408
00:29:59.083 --> 00:30:02.916
Don't you say her name.
Do not give Layla up.

409
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.500
Just give me the body.

410
00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:08.208
- No, I don't.
- May I speak with Marc?

411
00:30:08.708 --> 00:30:09.875
Um, uh...

412
00:30:09.958 --> 00:30:12.916
Marc,
what has Khonshu promised you?

413
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.666
That this is your last mission?
Then you'll be free?

414
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:21.333
Trust me when
I tell you Khonshu is a liar.

415
00:30:21.416 --> 00:30:23.875
There's always one last thing.

416
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.583
Sorry. If Ammit judges people pre-evil,
like, before the fact,

417
00:30:32.708 --> 00:30:35.166
then, isn't she judging
an innocent person?

418
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.625
I mean, a thought can't be evil, can it?

419
00:30:38.708 --> 00:30:41.458
I think about killing
my boss all the time,

420
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:44.000
- but I wouldn't actually do it.
- Steven...

421
00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:48.541
What about a child? Would she kill a child
for something they might do in 30 years?

422
00:30:49.875 --> 00:30:51.541
I'm glad you mentioned that.

423
00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:57.750
Sometimes, the cure is
a little taste of the disease.

424
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:02.708
The difference between medicine
and poison sometimes is only dosage.

425
00:31:03.125 --> 00:31:05.333
Consider a diseased limb.

426
00:31:06.666 --> 00:31:09.583
Amputation, horrific and grotesque,

427
00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:13.375
is necessary for the larger health.

428
00:31:13.875 --> 00:31:16.833
But the child is not a diseased limb.

429
00:31:17.541 --> 00:31:20.083
Sorry, is that... Is that what...

430
00:31:21.416 --> 00:31:24.708
You're all into that, like,
killing children and that?

431
00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.875
Maybe that's just me, but that's...

432
00:31:26.958 --> 00:31:30.958
I kind of draw a line there
at child murder.

433
00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:38.750
Do you know what this is?

434
00:31:40.958 --> 00:31:44.208
- Yep. It's a cane, yeah.
- This is...

435
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.583
Ammit's gift to her first Avatar.

436
00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:51.625
All right.

437
00:31:53.666 --> 00:31:55.041
It contains in it

438
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:59.541
a tiny sliver of her power.

439
00:32:00.541 --> 00:32:01.916
I don't wanna use it.

440
00:32:03.833 --> 00:32:05.958
- I don't.
- Then don't.

441
00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:10.000
- I can't help you.
- Yes, you can.

442
00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:14.166
I need to know, where is the scarab?

443
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.166
Where is the scarab?

444
00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:22.791
- Where is the scarab?
- No.

445
00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:25.458
- Where's the scarab?
- I have it.

446
00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:38.583
You couldn't possibly understand
the value of what you're holding.

447
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:42.000
Let me have that, I'll keep it safe.

448
00:32:42.083 --> 00:32:46.958
There is no deal in this, Marc.
Fix this. Fix this!

449
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.625
Summon the suit.

450
00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:52.041
Sorry, what?

451
00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:55.333
Summon the suit.

452
00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:57.934
- "Summon the soup"? What are you saying?
- The suit. Summon it.

453
00:32:57.958 --> 00:32:59.678
- The suit?
- And keep this safe.

454
00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:02.125
- So be it.
- Let's go, let's go.

455
00:33:03.083 --> 00:33:04.125
Get off, get off her!

456
00:33:12.666 --> 00:33:14.375
Steven!

457
00:33:31.958 --> 00:33:33.041
That was awesome.

458
00:33:50.125 --> 00:33:52.416
Here. Bolt the door.

459
00:33:56.666 --> 00:33:57.875
Oh, my God.

460
00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:01.833
I'm going to die
in an evil magician's man cave.

461
00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:05.083
No. Hey. Listen to me. Listen to me.

462
00:34:05.166 --> 00:34:07.458
Your name is Marc. There's a suit.

463
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:11.041
- I've seen you use it. You bring it out.
- No.

464
00:34:11.125 --> 00:34:13.642
- Where are you? We need you to fight.
- Let me in, Steven!

465
00:34:13.666 --> 00:34:16.750
- No. I can't. Stop, please, both of you.
- Let me in. There's no more time.

466
00:34:16.833 --> 00:34:20.083
- Please, stop.
- Listen to me. Your name is Marc.

467
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.000
Bring it out!

468
00:34:24.083 --> 00:34:26.291
Let me in. Let me in.

469
00:34:27.416 --> 00:34:28.750
Let me in, Steven.

470
00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:31.958
Where the hell are you? You need to fight!

471
00:34:32.041 --> 00:34:34.375
Please stop.
Leave me alone, both of you!

472
00:34:34.458 --> 00:34:35.500
Hey!

473
00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.500
You can do this, I promise.

474
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.041
Steven...

475
00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:46.041
I can't. I can't.

476
00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:49.375
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do it.

477
00:34:49.458 --> 00:34:52.000
It's all right. Okay.

478
00:34:52.083 --> 00:34:54.625
We'll just find another way.

479
00:34:55.666 --> 00:34:57.291
Come on. Come on, let's go.

480
00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:04.375
Jackal. Jackal. Jackal!

481
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.166
What jackal?

482
00:35:06.666 --> 00:35:08.625
Jackal. Jackal...

483
00:35:11.958 --> 00:35:13.458
Summon the suit!

484
00:35:13.541 --> 00:35:14.541
Suit!

485
00:35:30.041 --> 00:35:31.791
That should have been much worse.

486
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.333
Oy, Steven,
what the hell are we wearing?

487
00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:37.916
I don't know.
She said I needed a suit.

488
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.916
Yeah, the ceremonial armor from Khonshu's
temple, not psycho Colonel Sanders.

489
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.875
Well, I don't know how
any of this shit works, man. I...

490
00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:47.333
Well, think I do look sharp, though.

491
00:35:47.416 --> 00:35:50.416
- All right, where is the scarab?
- Scarab... Oh, um...

492
00:35:52.916 --> 00:35:55.333
What's this?
What are these little poles for?

493
00:35:57.208 --> 00:35:58.875
Pretty cool, actually.

494
00:36:00.041 --> 00:36:01.791
Ha. I like this.

495
00:36:22.083 --> 00:36:24.458
You look different.

496
00:36:32.416 --> 00:36:34.250
- Stay away from me!
- Wait, wh...

497
00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:29.916
Give me control, Steven.
You can't handle this.

498
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.875
I think I can.
Get away from her, you.

499
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.875
Yeah, I see you, you plug-ugly coyote.

500
00:37:39.083 --> 00:37:42.875
You're in the wrong ends, mate.
You're in my yard now.

501
00:37:43.083 --> 00:37:47.000
Yeah. Come on. Come on.
That's right. Come on.

502
00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:50.333
Ooh, lookie here. Lookie here.

503
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.333
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,
my name is Steven with a V.

504
00:37:56.791 --> 00:38:00.125
Oh, my God. Here you come, come on!

505
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.625
What?

506
00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:08.333
I did it! You got planted!

507
00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:10.458
Layla, Layla! Did you see that?

508
00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:19.041
Do you reckon he's havin' a seizure?

509
00:38:19.125 --> 00:38:22.041
Nah, look at him.
He's just a fancy drunk.

510
00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:26.291
Oh!

511
00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:52.166
That was a hell of a punch back there.

512
00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:54.750
Look around.

513
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.333
Someone's gonna get hurt
if you don't let me help.

514
00:38:58.583 --> 00:39:01.833
All right. Do it. Take control. For now.

515
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.666
Get it out of here.

516
00:40:00.833 --> 00:40:02.750
Come on. Come on.

517
00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:05.416
That's it. Just a little further.

518
00:40:05.583 --> 00:40:07.000
Gotcha!

519
00:40:40.083 --> 00:40:42.500
No, no. Where is it? Where is it?

520
00:40:42.875 --> 00:40:43.875
Shit!

521
00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.291
Shit!

522
00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:56.208
I'm sorry, but that belongs to me.

523
00:40:57.208 --> 00:41:00.375
I can offer you food, clothing,

524
00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.666
but I am unable
to offer you this. Thank you.

525
00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:08.583
I wish you could live
to see the world we make.

526
00:41:40.833 --> 00:41:42.458
So, this is what it's like?

527
00:41:43.916 --> 00:41:45.333
Being on the inside?

528
00:41:49.208 --> 00:41:50.208
Yeah.

529
00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:54.583
- It's horrible.
- It's all right. You're all right.

530
00:41:58.791 --> 00:42:01.916
- I feel like I can scarcely move.
- It's all right, just breathe through it.

531
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.166
It gets easier.

532
00:42:04.125 --> 00:42:05.958
How long have you been doing this?

533
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:12.125
I don't know. It's... A long time.

534
00:42:12.208 --> 00:42:13.791
- I don't like it.
- Long time.

535
00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:17.416
I don't want it. Can I have my body back?

536
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.000
- I can't do that right now, Steven.
- Please.

537
00:42:20.583 --> 00:42:21.791
I'm taking it back.

538
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.583
Sorry.

539
00:42:29.666 --> 00:42:32.666
We've always managed to keep a wall
between us, but something's changed.

540
00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:36.291
The one who controls the body
has become stronger.

541
00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:39.291
The reflections help,
but most of the time,

542
00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:42.125
it'll take all your willpower
just to be a fly on the wall.

543
00:42:42.208 --> 00:42:46.208
You can't do this, keeping me
trapped in here. You have no right.

544
00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:48.458
My whole life...

545
00:42:48.916 --> 00:42:52.208
I can't go on a bloody date.
I can barely keep a goldfish alive.

546
00:42:52.291 --> 00:42:55.416
I lost my job. It's been you.
It's always been you,

547
00:42:56.041 --> 00:42:58.916
eating away at parts of my life
like a parasite.

548
00:42:59.375 --> 00:43:02.791
Look, when I am done,
when I have repaid my debt,

549
00:43:02.875 --> 00:43:06.250
I swear to you, you will never
see me or hear from me again.

550
00:43:06.708 --> 00:43:10.750
I promise you. We wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for Khonshu. And my...

551
00:43:12.458 --> 00:43:15.250
servitude is the price that I pay.

552
00:43:16.208 --> 00:43:19.291
- What kind of servitude?
- The kind that leaves me covered in blood.

553
00:43:19.375 --> 00:43:21.916
Yeah, well, that blood is on my hands.

554
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.750
You ruin people's lives.
Everything you touch, you ruin.

555
00:43:24.833 --> 00:43:28.083
You hurt people, you abandoned
your wife. You left her stranded.

556
00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:31.166
I did not. I am protecting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.

557
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.750
- Yes, you did. I saw.
- Khonshu has his eyes on her.

558
00:43:33.833 --> 00:43:36.833
He wants her as my replacement.
I'm never gonna let that happen.

559
00:43:36.916 --> 00:43:39.333
You're a liar. I don't believe you.
I don't trust you.

560
00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:41.625
- You hurt people.
- I'm never letting him near her.

561
00:43:41.708 --> 00:43:43.875
- Just shut up!
- I won't let you hurt anyone again.

562
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:47.333
I will never give you
a moment of peace, I promise.

563
00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:49.166
Shut up!

564
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:53.333
You shut up! Shut up!

565
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:14.375
You swore
he would not interfere.

566
00:44:15.458 --> 00:44:17.750
I know. I'll handle it.

567
00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:20.916
- You have proven you cannot.
- I will.

568
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.458
Ungrateful, Marc,
altering the terms of our agreement.

569
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:30.375
You were nothing more
than a corpse when I found you.

570
00:44:30.458 --> 00:44:35.000
You think you own this body?

571
00:44:37.458 --> 00:44:41.208
- It belongs to me.
- We'll find the scarab.

572
00:44:43.083 --> 00:44:45.333
Too late. Harrow has it.

573
00:44:47.416 --> 00:44:48.958
Then we'll find another way.

574
00:44:49.541 --> 00:44:51.291
We'll get to Ammit's tomb first.

575
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.916
You know I'll protect you
with everything I have.

576
00:44:56.666 --> 00:45:01.500
- You are worth protecting.
- I'll do whatever it takes then.

577
00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:03.416
Then you let me go.

578
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.250
I know that you enjoy the work
I have for you.

579
00:45:06.958 --> 00:45:09.666
- We need each other.
- We have a deal.

580
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:15.041
Let me remind you, should we part,
you may not like my next candidate,

581
00:45:15.125 --> 00:45:19.375
near and dear as she is to you.

582
00:45:25.333 --> 00:45:26.541
Where are we going?

583
00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.208
Where the hell do you think?

584
00:50:30.791 --> 00:50:32.476
For information on
mental health resources near you,
