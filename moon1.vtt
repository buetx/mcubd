2
00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:29.666
Morning, Gus, my little one-finned wonder.

3
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.708
Hello, Mom. It's me. Just checkin' in.

4
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:37.625
I got your postcard,
putting it up on Gus' tank now.

5
00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:40.541
Yeah, it's very nice.
He is fuming, though.

6
00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:43.791
Keeps asking why
I don't take him anywhere nice.

7
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.166
Maybe one day, right?

8
00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:48.416
He'd love to get out there,
but it's a bit hard with one fin, innit?

9
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.416
Anyway, Mom,
all's well here. Not too bad.

10
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.750
Still wake up every morning
still feeling like I got hit by a bus.

11
00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:53.583
And if you...

12
00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:57.583
Hey, mate, still selling
the old brushes and brooms, right?

13
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.958
Right in front of my entrance. It's...
Got no problem with it. Cheers.

14
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.166
Anyway, sorry I missed you, Mom.

15
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.875
I'll try you again tomorrow.
Laters, gators.

16
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.083
Oh, bloody hell. Wait!

17
00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:14.083
Bollocks.

18
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.166
Cheers.

19
00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:37.583
Hmm.

20
00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:40.750
Will you look at that?

21
00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:42.708
Looks like someone mistook

22
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.833
the Great Pyramid of Giza
for a rubbish dump.

23
00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:47.083
It's not like there's anything in there.

24
00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:49.375
Yeah. Maybe not.

25
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.125
But in there

26
00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:54.916
is something wicked.

27
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.916
Check it out. They'd take
this big metal hook, right?

28
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.125
And they go up the old nozzle and...

29
00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:05.916
All the organs would come out.
Except for the heart.

30
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.166
How come?

31
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.041
Because they believed
you needed your heart

32
00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:10.916
to be judged in the Underworld

33
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.125
and only the worthiest would be allowed
to pass through the Field of Reeds.

34
00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:18.833
And did it suck for you?
Getting rejected from the Field of Reeds?

35
00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:21.791
That doesn't make sense
'cause I'm not dead, am I?

36
00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:23.041
- Stevie.
- Am I...

37
00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:27.000
- That better not be you again.
- Sorry, Donna. Yeah, sorry. Got it.

38
00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:29.250
There we go.

39
00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:32.166
Don't know how many times
I have to tell you this.

40
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.375
You're not the bloody tour guide, Stevie.

41
00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:37.708
Steven, actually. I am... Steven.

42
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:38.833
No, you're bloody useless

43
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:41.416
unless you're actually doing
what you're paid to do,

44
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500
which is to sell these to children.

45
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.500
Got it.

46
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:53.041
Hello.

47
00:05:53.208 --> 00:05:55.833
- Hello.
- How's the sugar trade going?

48
00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:58.250
I don't know what this
has to do with Egypt really.

49
00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:00.625
They didn't have that
back then, did they? No.

50
00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:03.500
They liked figs and dates, and...

51
00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:07.125
My next tour's here but just checking,
we still on for 7:00 tomorrow?

52
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:12.375
- "7:00 tomorrow"?
- "Best steak in town"?

53
00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:15.166
- Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

54
00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.625
Sorry. But...

55
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.916
- What?
- Are you asking me out?

56
00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:27.750
You're funny. I'll see you then.

57
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.166
Stevie, you absolute rascal.
I didn't know you had taken a crack.

58
00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.833
I didn't know either.

59
00:06:34.416 --> 00:06:36.000
Hang on, did she say steak?

60
00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:38.875
What in the world's a bloody vegan
gonna eat in a steak house?

61
00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.291
I don't know, Donna. Salad? Bread?

62
00:06:42.416 --> 00:06:46.208
Yeah, I can see why she went for it.
Real catch you are.

63
00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:55.250
- Bring those hippos up here, will you?
- Yeah, sure.

64
00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:59.416
Taweret. The hippo, Goddess Taweret.
Oh, Donna, that reminds me.

65
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.041
When I was coming in this morning,
I saw the banners outside.

66
00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.208
And that's what made you
late for work again, was it?

67
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:05.291
No. Sorry about that.

68
00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:07.216
- The bus came early...
- Third time this week

69
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.166
- you've shuffled in like a lazy sod.
- I know.

70
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.000
That's why you'll be
on inventory this week. Well done.

71
00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:13.916
All right. Aye, aye, Captain.

72
00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:15.726
But no. I wanted to tell you that

73
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.333
the banners and the posters
of the Ennead...

74
00:07:18.416 --> 00:07:19.791
- The what?
- The Ennead?

75
00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:22.208
You know, like,
the super group of Egyptian gods?

76
00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:25.541
- You got Horus, Osiris, Tefnut...
- Stop, please.

77
00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:29.458
If this is some weird audition
to tour guide here, the answer's still no.

78
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:32.541
No. What I'm trying...
That's actually crushing to hear.

79
00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:34.666
But what I'm trying to point out...

80
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.250
I'm not trying to slag off marketing,
but there's been a major blunder

81
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:41.250
because they've got seven gods here,
and the Ennead has nine.

82
00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.291
I fired two of them for bein' late.

83
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:48.166
Listen, if you don't stop natterin' at me,
I swear I'll shove you in a sarcophagus.

84
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.083
You can tell the pharaoh in there
what's wrong with them and all.

85
00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:53.833
- Go on.
- All right.

86
00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:57.166
- Go. Now. Oh, leave it.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

87
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.000
Just leave it. Get out. Go away from me.

88
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.750
All right, always lovely to chat.

89
00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:12.083
- Hey. Good night, J.B.
- Good night, Scotty.

90
00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:14.291
- See ya, mate.
- Scotty?

91
00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:18.791
It's Steven. With a "V".

92
00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:19.958
Huh.

93
00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:22.875
See you tomorrow.

94
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:28.000
Honestly, it's like
my body wants to get up

95
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:32.166
and wander about, you know, like it
has to get the 10,000 steps in.

96
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.375
You know? And I don't even
know about it until I wake up wherever.

97
00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:40.916
That's why I try to stay awake
at night. What do you think?

98
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.041
Nah. You're right. I mean, I guess

99
00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:45.625
there are stranger things
that people do, but...

100
00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.083
No? Well, I think
it's a bit... I'm sorry.

101
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:52.625
Extra pralines for the man himself.

102
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.333
So, the girl I was telling you about,
the one from work.

103
00:08:56.416 --> 00:08:58.333
- We're going on a date tomorrow.
- Excuse me.

104
00:08:58.416 --> 00:09:00.208
- Can you take our picture with him?
- Sure.

105
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:01.750
- Thank you.
- We're going on a date.

106
00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.333
I didn't even ask her.
I don't know how it happened.

107
00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:07.083
One. Two. Three.

108
00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:10.375
- There you are. Cheers.
- Thank you.

109
00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.750
- Don't forget the tip.
- Oh, yes.

110
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:15.708
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

111
00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:20.958
Anyway, if I am gonna have
a girlfriend, at some point,

112
00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:25.458
obviously can't have
ankle restraints on my bed, can I?

113
00:09:25.583 --> 00:09:28.500
That's like the definition
of a red flag, isn't it?

114
00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:32.583
You know what I mean, yeah?
Yeah, you know what I mean.

115
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.708
Gotta figure something out.

116
00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:39.791
All right, I better jog on.

117
00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:42.416
Nice catching up.

118
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:47.166
I will see you on the flip-flop.

119
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:49.791
All right, laters.

120
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:18.291
Hello! And welcome to Staying Awake.

121
00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:21.708
Let's start with trying to solve a puzzle.

122
00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:24.666
Solving puzzles is a great way
to keep your mind awake.

123
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.500
Bored with puzzles? Try a book.

124
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:31.583
Reading can keep
your mind alert and focused.

125
00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:34.750
Imagine being in the story you're reading.

126
00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:37.500
Is there an exciting chapter
you'd like to be a part of?

127
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:42.500
Just remember, you'll need about
five hours to keep your natural self.

128
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:47.083
Hello! And welcome to
Staying Awake.

129
00:10:47.166 --> 00:10:49.458
Let's start with trying to solve a puzzle.

130
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.333
Solving puzzles is a great way
to keep your mind awake.

131
00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:53.791
Bored with puzzles?

132
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.041
Try a book.

133
00:10:56.166 --> 00:11:00.333
Hello! Reading... Is there a chapter
you'd like to be a part of?

134
00:11:13.666 --> 00:11:14.791
Oh, my God.

135
00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.291
Ah!

136
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:23.375
Oh, that was weird.
What happened?

137
00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:26.125
What... What was that?

138
00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:40.958
- Go back to sleep, worm.
- Hello?

139
00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:47.541
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Yep. I completely agree.

140
00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:52.541
- Where are you?
- Surrender the body to Marc.

141
00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:55.750
Sorry, what? "The body"? What...

142
00:11:57.333 --> 00:12:01.208
- "Surrender the body"? What body?
- Oh, the idiot's in control.

143
00:12:15.416 --> 00:12:16.500
Hello.

144
00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:19.250
Hi...

145
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.041
What are you doing?

146
00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:23.541
No, no, no!

147
00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:25.750
Don't just stand there. Run!

148
00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:28.041
No, no, no! No! Please!

149
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.083
He's heading for the village.

150
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:42.791
What a beautiful day.

151
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.166
It's like we're in Heaven.
Only it's not Heaven, is it?

152
00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:50.833
It's a darkness. Sometimes
it hides in our very hearts.

153
00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:54.083
We are here to make the Earth
as much like Heaven as possible.

154
00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:56.875
Who'd like to go first?

155
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:04.500
You're a brave man.
Offering your soul for judgment.

156
00:14:04.583 --> 00:14:08.291
Wanting to serve our goddess
even before she wakes.

157
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:20.083
I judge you in Ammit's name
with but a fraction of her power.

158
00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:30.666
This is the face of a good man.

159
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.271
Thank you.

160
00:14:44.458 --> 00:14:46.041
Who would like to go next?

161
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.750
Please, Harrow. I must know.

162
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.041
Call me Arthur. Come.

163
00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:56.041
Will you accept your scales,
regardless of the outcome?

164
00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:57.250
Yes.

165
00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.291
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.916
I've been good my entire life.

167
00:15:14.041 --> 00:15:15.291
I believe you.

168
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:21.750
But the scales see everything.
Perhaps it's something that lies ahead.

169
00:15:22.541 --> 00:15:26.791
Well... I wish you could live
to see the world we make.

170
00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:29.333
Yet, Ammit has decided.

171
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.958
I'm sorry. There was
a problem with the exchange.

172
00:15:53.041 --> 00:15:56.000
We got ambushed.
Someone killed two of our men.

173
00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:57.833
Is he still here?

174
00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.000
We think so, yes.

175
00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:07.041
- Oh, bollocks.
- You...

176
00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:10.541
I know you.

177
00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:13.333
Me? Hi, uh...

178
00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:15.958
Mercenary.

179
00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.125
"Mercenary"? No, no. I'm not a mercenary.

180
00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:21.458
No, I'm a gift shop-ist.

181
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.333
I work at a gift shop.
My name's Steven Grant.

182
00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:26.625
Uh...

183
00:16:27.208 --> 00:16:29.375
I'm trying to get back home.
Back to London.

184
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:33.583
London?
Don't know why I'm saying it like that.

185
00:16:33.666 --> 00:16:36.791
- Well, Steven Grant of the gift shop.
- Yeah?

186
00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:41.083
- Will you return the scarab?
- The... The what? Oh, all right.

187
00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:44.291
Yeah, the... Oh, you mean...

188
00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:47.833
- You will give him nothing.
- Here.

189
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:56.166
I strongly encourage you to return that.

190
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.208
I'm not... I'm...

191
00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:03.666
I'm try...

192
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:07.916
Come on, now. It's like
my fingers froze.

193
00:17:08.583 --> 00:17:12.708
But here's some of that... I don't know,
maybe it's the high altitude or something.

194
00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:13.833
Ah!

195
00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:16.208
There, take it. So strange. Sorry, but...

196
00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:20.041
- I will not ask again.
- I didn't do that on purpose.

197
00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:22.583
I don't know what's happening.

198
00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:26.458
There we go. Just take it,
take it, take it, take it.

199
00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:28.767
- Oh, God! Now I'm trying to stop my legs.
- Take him!

200
00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:32.875
I can't... I'm trying to stop my legs from
moving. I'm trying to give it to you.

201
00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.000
- Wait, wait, wait!
- It's all right.

202
00:17:35.083 --> 00:17:37.875
I'm trying, mate.
I swear I'm trying to give it to you.

203
00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:41.916
Got it!

204
00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:47.875
No. The idiot's back.

205
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.250
Ah...

206
00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:50.666
Oh...

207
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.500
Sorry.

208
00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:55.375
Oh, God.

209
00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:02.833
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna go, all right? Yeah.

210
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.208
Oh, God. Oh, God.

211
00:18:06.416 --> 00:18:09.708
I see you're angry. I know
I've made you angry. I'm sorry, yeah?

212
00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:11.958
Please, I don't...

213
00:18:13.833 --> 00:18:14.916
Oh, God.

214
00:18:15.041 --> 00:18:16.833
Don't you dare
drop the scarab.

215
00:18:16.916 --> 00:18:18.375
All right, all right, all right!

216
00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:25.916
That is my van! That is my van!

217
00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:40.708
What am I doing? What am I doing?
I don't even have my license.

218
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.916
Oh, my God.

219
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.833
Bugger, there's so many of them.

220
00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.958
This has to be a dream.
This has to be a dream.

221
00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:56.041
They're gonna kill me.
They're gonna kill me.

222
00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:59.291
Come on, you bloody
cupcake van! Move it!

223
00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:24.000
Come on! Move your ass!
Thank you. So sorry. Thank you.

224
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.250
Charming.

225
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:49.500
Wait, wait, wait! I'm sorry, I'm sorry
about the cupcake. No, no, no!

226
00:19:57.083 --> 00:20:00.791
Wake up, Marc! If he loses
the scarab, I'll kill you both.

227
00:20:00.916 --> 00:20:02.666
I don't understand what's happening!

228
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:04.333
- Truck, stupid!
- What?

229
00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:05.458
Truck!

230
00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:21.458
No!

231
00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:25.125
Oh, no, no, no!

232
00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:36.291
Huh? Oh, God.

233
00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.375
I'm driving backwards.

234
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.791
- Did he just throw the gun?
- I don't know what I'm doing.

235
00:20:45.916 --> 00:20:47.750
Then leave us be, parasite!

236
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:58.250
Oh, come on, come on.

237
00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:11.041
Oh, shit!

238
00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:28.250
Oh, God.

239
00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:30.666
Oh, God.

240
00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:45.958
What Neanderthals dreamed of.
The paleoanthropologists...

241
00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:49.208
How we doin', Gus? You sleep all right?

242
00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:50.458
Hmm?

243
00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:53.916
I wonder what fishes dream about.

244
00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:14.625
What the... Fish.

245
00:22:16.208 --> 00:22:17.666
What do you mean, "grew back"?

246
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.708
Yesterday, that fish had one fin.
It was like that when I bought him.

247
00:22:20.791 --> 00:22:22.875
- Today, what do you see?
- I see two...

248
00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:26.000
Two fins! Yeah, sorry.
But, yeah, he's got two fins now.

249
00:22:26.083 --> 00:22:27.875
So, is that normal, or...

250
00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:29.541
Well, if you wanna
swap it, go ahead.

251
00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:31.625
But, like I said yesterday,
they've all got...

252
00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:33.583
What do you mean?
I wasn't here yesterday.

253
00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:34.708
Yeah, all right.

254
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:37.666
Look, as I said, they've all got two fins.

255
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.625
I don't care what that Nemo movie says.

256
00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:42.291
Find a pet shop that sells
disabled fish and go there.

257
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:45.208
- I don't have time for this.
- Wait, is that... Is that clock right?

258
00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:46.916
No, that's impossible,
I just woke up.

259
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.750
Are you mad? The fish is wrong,
the time is wrong. You're not quite right.

260
00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:53.708
Bugger, I've got a date.
Sorry, I've got a date.

261
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:02.666
All right.

262
00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:09.125
You look like a knob.

263
00:23:13.916 --> 00:23:15.916
We still expecting one more?

264
00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:19.375
Yes. It's not looking so good, is it?

265
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.500
Punchy. Calling me now?

266
00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:42.791
What? What do you mean? I'm at
the restaurant for steak. It's steak time.

267
00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:46.791
Yeah, I ate steak by myself, thanks.
Two days ago.

268
00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:50.416
What? I thought we said Friday? Today.

269
00:23:51.125 --> 00:23:53.291
Right. Welcome to Sunday.

270
00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:59.250
Come on, no. I think Friday
still comes after Thursday, doesn't it?

271
00:23:59.416 --> 00:24:01.541
It doesn't change the fact
that today is Sunday,

272
00:24:01.625 --> 00:24:03.416
which means "lose my number."

273
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.416
Cheers.

274
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.916
But...

275
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.750
Sorry, what day is it today?

276
00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:15.750
- Sunday, sir.
- No.

277
00:24:16.208 --> 00:24:17.208
Is it...

278
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:18.541
Really?

279
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.666
The kitchen's closing soon.

280
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:27.208
Okay. Um... You know what?

281
00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:30.250
I'll have a steak, please.

282
00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:33.583
Sure. What cut would you like?

283
00:24:35.333 --> 00:24:36.333
I see.

284
00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:37.458
Um...

285
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.083
I'll have the best bit of the...

286
00:24:42.041 --> 00:24:44.166
The steak.
That's the bit that I want.

287
00:24:45.041 --> 00:24:48.708
The center-cut's fillet.
And how would you like that?

288
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:52.458
Good, yeah. Very good. Very good. Yeah.

289
00:24:54.208 --> 00:24:57.208
- I'll... I'll put you for well done.
- Okay. All right.

290
00:24:57.291 --> 00:25:00.083
Yeah. That sounds delicious.

291
00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:12.125
Yeah, you know,
I think she really liked me.

292
00:25:12.208 --> 00:25:15.291
She loved the flowers. Yeah.

293
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.500
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
bring her around soon, I think.

294
00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:22.041
Yeah, I think you'd love her.
Yeah, she's got a great sense of humor.

295
00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:26.958
So... Anyway, I'll tell you more about it
tomorrow. Love you. Laters, gators.

296
00:26:05.916 --> 00:26:07.500
Do you want some?

297
00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:12.083
All right.

298
00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:14.916
You can have some sprinkles.

299
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:27.083
If you're Gus,
I'm the bloody Queen of Sheba.

300
00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:44.916
What's this?

301
00:27:20.416 --> 00:27:21.708
What is this about?

302
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:49.916
There we are.

303
00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:51.250
All right.

304
00:27:57.333 --> 00:27:58.333
Layla.

305
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:16.166
Yeah?

306
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.708
Oh, my God, you're alive.

307
00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:20.250
- Yeah, all right.
- That's it?

308
00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:23.000
I've been texting
and calling you for months.

309
00:28:23.083 --> 00:28:25.500
You couldn't give me
any sign that you were okay?

310
00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:27.666
I thought something
happened to you.

311
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.958
Where are you?
Where've you been?

312
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:31.166
Uh...

313
00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:33.458
Hello? You...

314
00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:36.625
Sorry, I just found this phone in my flat,

315
00:28:36.708 --> 00:28:39.333
and I'm just trying
to figure out whose it is.

316
00:28:39.416 --> 00:28:41.291
- What is with this accent?
- What?

317
00:28:41.916 --> 00:28:43.250
What is happening right now?

318
00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:46.250
Sorry, who do you think I am?

319
00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:49.333
What do you mean, "who"?
What's wrong with you, Marc?

320
00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:52.541
What did you just call me?

321
00:28:54.083 --> 00:28:55.083
Who is this?

322
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.125
Why did you call me "Marc"?

323
00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:02.458
Hello?

324
00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:06.750
No, no, no. Come on.

325
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:11.161
Steven.

326
00:29:14.541 --> 00:29:15.625
Steven.

327
00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:21.250
- Hello?
- Steven.

328
00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:27.250
- You need to stop.
- Who said that?

329
00:29:33.458 --> 00:29:36.500
- You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
- Oh, no, no, no, mate.

330
00:29:36.583 --> 00:29:38.291
Someone's having a laugh.

331
00:29:49.708 --> 00:29:51.791
Oh, God. Oh, God.

332
00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:00.416
Bloody hell.

333
00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:04.625
What the...

334
00:30:17.791 --> 00:30:18.875
Steven.

335
00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:22.041
Stop looking.

336
00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:29.416
Oh, God. What's happening?

337
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:30.958
What's happening?

338
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:35.583
Oh, God!

339
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.666
No, G. G, G. Let's go.
Come on. Ground floor.

340
00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:37.041
Hold the door.

341
00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:38.525
Thank you.

342
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.750
Hiya.

343
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:51.791
- Hi.
- You all right?

344
00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:54.041
Fine. Thank you.

345
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.583
Just lost my contact lens.

346
00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:58.791
Hope you find it.

347
00:31:59.916 --> 00:32:02.333
Electrical problems
in the building, innit?

348
00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:03.916
Always the same, isn't it?

349
00:32:04.708 --> 00:32:06.916
- Are we back on the fifth floor?
- Yes, the fifth.

350
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.708
My friend Claire lives here.
I'm visiting her.

351
00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:11.883
She's expecting me.

352
00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:15.500
What's going on?

353
00:32:47.208 --> 00:32:50.000
Oh, my God. He's real.

354
00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:00.666
Hey, J.B., how you doin', mate?

355
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.125
- How's it going, Scotty? All right, mate.
- It's Steven.

356
00:33:03.208 --> 00:33:06.000
- Are you watching otter videos again?
- They're adorable, mate.

357
00:33:06.083 --> 00:33:07.458
Great, yeah. Cool. Listen, man,

358
00:33:07.541 --> 00:33:10.750
I need you to keep an eye out,
'cause I'm being followed.

359
00:33:10.833 --> 00:33:13.208
- Really, mate?
- Yeah. Will you just,

360
00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:16.500
- like, not let anyone in, yeah?
- It's a museum. That'll be difficult.

361
00:33:16.583 --> 00:33:18.750
Obviously. I just mean,
like, anyone dodgy.

362
00:33:18.833 --> 00:33:20.708
Anyone who wants
to come in can, it's free.

363
00:33:20.791 --> 00:33:23.125
- I get it. This man...
- Can you take these downstairs?

364
00:33:23.208 --> 00:33:24.666
- Wait. I know.
- Gotta go, it's Mom.

365
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.833
- I get it. Just a second.
- Take it downstairs now.

366
00:33:26.916 --> 00:33:29.625
- Just help me out...
- Can you take this downstairs, please?

367
00:33:29.958 --> 00:33:32.250
Oh, my God.
That man was on the bus.

368
00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:34.500
I don't give a monkey's.
Take these downstairs...

369
00:33:34.583 --> 00:33:37.875
Will you...
Please, just give me a minute?

370
00:33:37.958 --> 00:33:39.958
Yeah? Thanks, Donna.

371
00:33:40.666 --> 00:33:42.833
You're still on inventory tonight.

372
00:33:57.708 --> 00:33:59.916
- So you really do work here.
- Oh, God.

373
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.416
I'd assumed Steven Grant was an alias.
Imagine my surprise to find you here.

374
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.291
Excuse me, Ronnie. This man
right here has been following me.

375
00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:09.041
- Now, I don't know...
- Praise Ammit.

376
00:34:10.458 --> 00:34:14.250
- Thank you.
- Ronnie, you're part of this?

377
00:34:16.708 --> 00:34:19.625
Mate, I don't have
your bloody beetle. I swear. I...

378
00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:24.333
Oh, no. The scarab doesn't belong to me.
It belongs to her. Do you know Ammit?

379
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:27.958
Do I know Ammit... No, not personally.

380
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.541
Egyptian deity, right?

381
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.250
World's first bogeyman.

382
00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:36.541
She was only
the bogeyman for evildoers.

383
00:34:36.625 --> 00:34:38.791
- Right.
- She grew weary of having to wait

384
00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:41.375
for sinners to commit their crime
before punishing them.

385
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:44.250
Would you wait to weed a garden
till after the roses were dead?

386
00:34:44.375 --> 00:34:45.750
I wouldn't do that.

387
00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:49.458
The justice of Ammit surveys
the whole of our lives.

388
00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:51.500
- Got it.
- Past, present, future.

389
00:34:51.583 --> 00:34:53.708
She knows what we've done,
and what we will do.

390
00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:56.833
Great. Okay. Well, the books
must have left that part out.

391
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.375
Consider this...

392
00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:08.791
Had Ammit been free, she would have

393
00:35:08.875 --> 00:35:11.375
prevented Hitler
and the destruction he wrought.

394
00:35:12.041 --> 00:35:15.583
Nero, the Armenian genocide, Pol Pot.

395
00:35:15.666 --> 00:35:18.041
- Not nice people.
- But she was betrayed.

396
00:35:18.125 --> 00:35:21.750
- Was she?
- By indolent fellow gods.

397
00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:24.291
By even her own Avatar.

398
00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:27.125
"Avatars." Blue people.
Love that film.

399
00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:29.416
- By Avatar, what I mean...
- You mean the anime?

400
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.958
- Steven. Stop it.
- Are you going to kill me?

401
00:35:40.125 --> 00:35:41.791
It's maddening, isn't it?

402
00:35:42.875 --> 00:35:45.250
The voice in your head.

403
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.250
Relentless, forever unsatisfied.

404
00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:53.291
No matter how hard you try to please,

405
00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:57.208
it devours you
until there's nothing left

406
00:35:58.083 --> 00:35:59.583
but a hollow shell.

407
00:36:00.166 --> 00:36:02.250
And the more you ask for help,

408
00:36:02.375 --> 00:36:05.666
the more you begin to sound
like the boy who cried wolf.

409
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:08.291
I can't help you.

410
00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:11.083
I am trying to help you.

411
00:36:12.833 --> 00:36:15.083
I saw you kill that woman in the Alps.

412
00:36:15.708 --> 00:36:18.958
I only told her what
millions more will soon learn.

413
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:21.750
Do you wanna know the truth?

414
00:36:42.708 --> 00:36:44.333
There's chaos in you.

415
00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:46.041
There's what?

416
00:36:53.208 --> 00:36:54.291
Let him go.

417
00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:33.166
Oh, bloody hell.

418
00:37:37.916 --> 00:37:40.333
Hello? Donna?

419
00:37:42.958 --> 00:37:45.125
Pets allowed in the museum.

420
00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:48.125
Here, boy.

421
00:37:50.083 --> 00:37:51.166
Hello?

422
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Where are you, you little bugger?

423
00:38:02.958 --> 00:38:04.583
What are you doing, Steven?

424
00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:07.333
Here, boy.

425
00:38:09.875 --> 00:38:10.916
Hello?

426
00:38:16.041 --> 00:38:17.333
Oh, classic.

427
00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:20.375
I hear you, can you hear me?

428
00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:24.333
Oh.

429
00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:27.958
Yeah.

430
00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:54.375
Steven Grant of the gift shop.

431
00:38:54.458 --> 00:38:58.250
Give me the scarab
and you won't be torn apart.

432
00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:28.291
Good Lord!

433
00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:33.541
Oh, God!

434
00:39:36.333 --> 00:39:37.625
Oh, God.

435
00:39:39.166 --> 00:39:40.333
Steven...

436
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.041
Steven, I can save us.

437
00:39:44.666 --> 00:39:47.083
But I can't have you
fightin' me this time.

438
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.291
You need to give me control.
You understand?

439
00:39:50.375 --> 00:39:52.958
No, what... Control of what?
What are you talking about?

440
00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:56.416
That thing's about to break through
the door. We're out of time.

441
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.916
- All right, hey. Listen to me.
- Damn it! No!

442
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.083
- Listen. Look at me.
- No!

443
00:40:00.166 --> 00:40:01.500
- Look at me.
- You're not real!

444
00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:04.041
- This is real. I'm real.
- No! You're not real.

445
00:40:04.125 --> 00:40:07.083
- None of this is real.
- Yes. Steven. You gotta give me control.

446
00:40:07.166 --> 00:40:08.583
It's the only way.

447
00:40:08.708 --> 00:40:11.791
- Oh, God. I'm gonna die.
- You... Steven.

448
00:40:11.875 --> 00:40:14.458
- I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.
- Look at me.

449
00:40:15.208 --> 00:40:16.458
You're not gonna die.

450
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.708
Let me save us.

451
